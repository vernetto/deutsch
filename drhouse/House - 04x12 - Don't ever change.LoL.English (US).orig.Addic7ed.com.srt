00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,600
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,

2
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,900
BUT I'M NERVOUS.

3
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,400
ZEL TOV!

4
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,300
MAZEL TOV!

5
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:45,300


7
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,600
THIS IS A GREAT THING,
ROZ.

8
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,400
I AM SO HAPPY FOR YOU.

9
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,900
THANK YOU, MRS. SILVER.

10
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,400
YONATAN IS A GOOD MAN
FROM A GOOD FAMILY.

11
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,600
I KNOW YOU CHOSE WELL
FOR ME.

12
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,100
I'VE BEEN BLESSED.

IF YOU LIKE DARWIN
AND THE GALAPAGOS.

18
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,600
AMBER AND I
HAVE A LOT IN COMMON.

19
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,300
SHE'S A CUTTHROAT BITCH.

20
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,000
<i>YOU CRY OVER DARK VICTORY.</i>

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
BETTE DAVIS, ANOTHER STRONG,
ASSERTIVE WOMAN.

22
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,600
YOU DON'T LIKE STRONG.
YOU DON'T LIKE ASSERTIVE.

23
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,800
YOU LIKE NEEDY.

24
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,300
SHE'S NOT DYING, IS SHE?

25
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,300
YES. GO AWAY.

26
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,000
I GIVE IT TWO MONTHS.

27
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,600
HUNDRED BUCKS.

28
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,100
NOT REALLY FAIR.

29
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,600
YOU'RE NOT OBJECTIVE.

30
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,400
BUT I'M ALL ABOUT
THE TEACHING-

31
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,800
WE'RE AT FOUR MONTHS.

32
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,800
YOU HID THIS FROM ME?

33
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,100
I WAS WRONG, OKAY?

34
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,600
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE UPSET.

35
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,400
I THOUGHT YOU'D TRACK ME
DOWN IN HALLWAYS-

36
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,200
<i>I SHOULDN'T HAVE
DISCOUNTED THE SEX.</i>

37
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,400
<i>SHE'S OBVIOUSLY LIMBER ENOUGH</i>

38
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,100
TO PUT OFF THE MELTDOWN
FOR TWO MONTHS.

39
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,600
SHE'S NOT NEEDY.
I DON'T NEED NEEDY.

40
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,600
SHE'S SCARY.

41
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,100
WHY DOES SCARY NEED PATHETIC?

42
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,500
ARE YOU GONNA TALK
TO HER?

43
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,000
I DON'T SEE
THAT I HAVE ANY CHOICE.

44
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,400
YOU ALL RIGHT WITH THAT?

45
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,800
<i>NO IMPULSE
TO SAVE HER FROM ME?</i>

46
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,300
I'VE BROKEN
THE PATTERN, HOUSE.

47
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,900
WHICH IS WHY
THIS HAS A CHANCE.

48
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,200
<i>I KNOW
YOU'RE TOO SUSPICIOUS</i>

49
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,900
TO ACCEPT THAT
WITHOUT GETTING OUT YOUR RULER,

50
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,800
AND YOUR CALIPERS, AND
YOUR SCANNING EQUIPMENT, SO...

51
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,300
GO AHEAD.

52
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,300
GET IT OUT OF
YOUR SYSTEM.

53
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,100
38-YEAR-OLD FEMALE
WITH LOSS OF BLADDER CONTROL,

54
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,500
<i>BLOOD IN HER URINE,
AND A BROKEN LEG</i>

55
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,100
FROM COLLAPSING
AT HER WEDDING.

56
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
AMPICILLIN FOR THE UTI.
SHINY CAST FOR THE LEG.

57
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,300
YOU GUYS KNOW
WILSON'S DATING AMBER?

58
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:26,900
NO.

59
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,100
WILSON AND AMBER?

60
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:28,900
I KNEW.

61
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,200
I ASKED HER OUT.

62
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,700
SAID SHE'D JUST
STARTED SEEING SOMEONE.

63
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,100
<i>CULTURES WERE NEGATIVE
FOR UTIs.</i>

64
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,000
NO SIGNS OF PREVIOUS
TRAUMA OR STDs.

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,700
- KIDNEY CANCER. 
- CT WAS CLEAN FOR TUMORS AND KIDNEY STONES.

66
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,100
I THOUGHT AMBER
SCARED YOU GUYS.

67
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:40,800
SHE DOES.

68
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,700
BUT SHE ALSO HAS LEGS THAT GO
ALL THE WAY UP TO CANADA.

69
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,900
SO DO CANADIANS-DOESN'T MEAN
I WANNA DATE ONE.

70
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,500
HER SODIUM'S LOW-COULD BE
ENDOMETRIOSIS IN THE BLADDER.

71
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,100
LOW SODIUM
COULD ALSO BE FROM LOW FOOD.

72
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,200
HASIDIC JEWS
FAST ON THEIR WEDDING DAY.

73
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,000
OR SODIUM WAS ABSORBED BY
A TOXIN ALREADY IN HER SYSTEM.

74
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,200
WAS IT JUST THE LEGS,

75
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,700
OR DID YOU DETECT SOMETHING
RESEMBLING A SOUL?

76
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,900
SHE GREW ON ME.

77
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,700
IF THERE'S A TOXIN IN HER,
COULD BE CARBOLIC ACID.

78
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,200
I'M TALKING
ABOUT THE PATIENT NOW.

79
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,300
THAT MUCH CARBOLIC ACID,

80
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,800
SOMEONE WOULD HAVE HAD
TO POISON HER.

81
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,500
COULD HAVE BEEN A COSSACK-
IF THIS WAS 18TH CENTURY POLAND

82
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,900
AND COSSACKS WERE
INTO HOUSEHOLD CLEANSERS.

83
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,700
WHICH IS WHY IT'S MORE LIKELY
THAT THE POISONER WAS POISONEE.

84
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,100
SUICIDE'S A SIN.

85
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,700
COROLLARY OF "PEOPLE LIE"
IS "PEOPLE SIN."

86
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,000
AND IN MY WORLD,
PEOPLE INCLUDES JEWS.

87
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,900
SHE WAS GETTING MARRIED.

88
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,200
HASIDIC WOMEN MARRY YOUNG

89
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,800
SO THEY CAN START PUSHING OUT
LITTLE HASIDILINGS.

90
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,500
38 MEANS A WOMAN
NOT ON ANYONE'S HOT LIST

91
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,000
BEING PUSHED ONTO A GUY
WHO'S NOT ON ANYONE'S HOT LIST.

92
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,600
NO WAY OUT, NO WAY OUT.

93
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,900
ENDOMETRIOSIS FITS BETTER

94
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,600
THAN AN EPIPHANY
THAT HER LIFE IS MEANINGLESS.

95
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,100
WE SHOULD START HER ON A.I.s
AND DO A CYSTOSCOPY TO CONFIRM.

96
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,900
FINE, CHECK HER INNARDS
FOR BAD CELLS

97
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,600
AND HER HOME FOR BAD KARMA.

98
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,400
CARBOLIC ACID
SHOULD BE ON THE SHELF

99
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,300
RIGHT NEXT TO THE REGRET
AND THE SELF-LOATHING.

100
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,000
THESE PEOPLE ARE CRAZY.

101
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,600
YEAH. SHE SHOULD
BE SELF-HATING.

102
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,700
I'M NOT SELF-HATING.

103
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,500
I HATE RELIGIOUS PEOPLE WHO ARE
OUT OF TOUCH WITH REALITY.

104
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,300
YOU ONLY MARRY SOMEONE
YOU MET THREE TIMES

105
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,300
IF THEY'RE CARRYING
A LITTLE MISTAKE.

106
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,400
WHAT'S THEIR DIVORCE RATE?

107
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,100
<i>CLEANERS ARE ALL ORGANIC.</i>

108
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,800
NOTHING WITH CARBOLIC ACID.

109
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,500
YOU LIKE
HOW THEY HOOK UP?

110
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,900
ROMANCE IS JUST
EMOTIONAL FOREPLAY.

111
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,200
CANDLELIGHT MEALS,
FLOWERS.

112
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,400
IT'S AS MUCH A RITUAL
AS ANYTHING THESE PEOPLE DO.

113
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,700
<i>WHY NOT GO WITH SOMEONE
WHO'S PRE-VETTED,</i>

114
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,700
SHARES THE SAME VALUES?

115
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,700
<i>CUT TO THE QUICK.</i>

116
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,700
<i>VALUES MAY GIVE YOU
THE BIG PICTURE,</i>

117
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,500
<i>BUT TIME TOGETHER
GIVES YOU THE LITTLE PICTURE-</i>

118
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,300
<i>DOES SHE CHEW HER FOOD
TOO LOUD?</i>

119
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,200
<i>WILL SHE LEAVE YOU ALONE
DURING THE FINAL FOUR?</i>

120
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,200
YOU COMMIT
TO SOMETHING DEEPER,

121
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,600
YOU LET THE LITTLE
SURPRISES SLIDE.

122
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,600
SURPRISES KILL-
WHICH IS WHY I ONLY COMMIT

123
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,200
WHEN THERE ARE
NO MORE SURPRISES.

124
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,600
AND YOU HAVE NO MORE SURPRISES
FOR YOUR WIFE.

125
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,800
DO YOU THINK THIS CAME UP
ON DATE NUMBER TWO?

126
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,500
YOU EVER HEARD
OF A HASIDIC JEW INTO HARD ROCK?

127
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,100
SHE'S LISTED AS A PRODUCER
ON ALL OF THESE.

128
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,500
WHERE THERE'S ROCK AND ROLL,

129
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,100
AND SEX...

130
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,800
USUALLY, THERE'S DRUGS.

131
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,900
<i>I'M BAAL TESHUVAH.</i>

132
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,700
I BECAME HASIDIC
ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO.

133
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,500
AND BEFORE SIX MONTHS AGO?

134
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,600
MUSIC BUSINESS ISN'T
EXACTLY KNOWN FOR ITS HOLINESS.

135
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,000
HEROIN.

136
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,700
BUT I'VE BEEN CLEAN
FOR MONTHS.

137
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,000
YONATAN KNOWS.

138
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,500
THE BROAD STROKES.

139
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,900
HE NEVER ACTUALLY ASKS
THE DETAILS.

140
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,000
SAYS WHAT'S IMPORTANT
IS THE PERSON THAT I AM NOW,

141
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,800
NOT THE PERSON I WAS THEN.

142
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,200
HOW DO YOU GO
ALL THE WAY FROM-

143
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,500
JUST TOOK A CLASS.

144
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,200
THEN I TOOK ANOTHER CLASS.

145
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,000
AND YOU JUST COMPLETELY LEFT
THE MUSIC BUSINESS?

146
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,000
POP MUSIC IS CONSIDERED
FRIVOLOUS.

147
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,700
SAME REASON WE DON'T WATCH TV
OR GO TO MOVIES.

148
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,600
YOUR DRUG USE MAY HAVE CAUSED 
SOME LONG TERM DAMAGE.

149
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,900
<i>WE'RE GONNA NEED
TO TAKE A HAIR SAMPLE</i>

150
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,800
TO TEST FOR LATENT TOXINS.

151
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,700
<i>SO YOU CAN NEVER WATCH
STAR WARS AGAIN.</i>

152
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,000
YOU FIGURED
THAT I'LL HIRE YOU

153
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,600
IF YOU PROMISE
TO DUMP WILSON.

154
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,200
- HOW DID YOU-
- WILSON HAD A KEY.

155
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,900
<i>YOU FIGURE THAT I'LL MAKE
YOUR LIFE HELL AT FIRST,</i>

156
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,400
BUT I'LL EVENTUALLY SEE
HOW GOOD YOU ARE AND KEEP YOU.

157
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,500
IT'S A GOOD PLAN,
DON'T YOU THINK?

158
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,900
PERFECTLY TAILORED
TO YOUR PERSONALITY.

159
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,700
NO, IT'S NOT.

160
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,200
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT.

161
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,600
<i>MEANS YOU JUST WANNA STAY
IN MY ORBIT.</i>

162
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,100
'CAUSE YOU FIGURE
I'LL EVENTUALLY REALIZE

163
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,100
THAT I MADE A MISTAKE

164
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,000
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE
TO RUB MY FACE IN IT.

165
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:42,200
I CAN'T WAIT.
IT'S GONNA BE AWESOME.

166
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,900
NO, IT'S NOT.
AND YOU KNOW IT'S NOT.

167
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,700
<i>'CAUSE YOU KNOW THAT EVEN
IF I MADE A MISTAKE,</i>

168
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,500
<i>I'D NEVER ADMIT
THAT I MADE A MISTAKE.</i>

169
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,100
WHICH MEANS THAT YOU'RE
JUST TOYING WITH WILSON

170
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,900
TO TOY WITH ME.

171
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,800
YOUR GOAL
IS PURE FERAL VENGEANCE.

172
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,200
INNOCENT BYSTANDER,

173
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,500
BUT THERE'S
A GREATER GOOD.

174
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,400
NO, THAT'S NOT IT.

175
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,800
BECAUSE A BAG
OF FLAMING POOP

176
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,700
BYPASSES THE BYSTANDER.

177
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,300
SO...

178
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,800
WHICH IS IT, HOUSE?

179
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,600
AM I IN THIS FOR YOU...

180
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,000
OR AM I IN THIS FOR HIM?

181
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,700
GIVE HIM BACK
HIS SWEATSHIRT.

182
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,400
PIT STAINS
DON'T BECOME YOU.

183
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,800
TREATMENT HAD NO EFFECT.

184
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,800
RULES OUT ENDOMETRIOSIS.

185
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,200
AND HER HAIR SAMPLE
WAS NEGATIVE

186
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,200
FOR RESIDUE DRUGS.

187
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,400
THIS WOMAN LIVED
IN THE FAST LANE

188
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,200
TILL SIX MONTHS AGO.

189
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,200
MAYBE WE'RE MISSING
SOMETHING.

190
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,100
SHE ADMITTED DRUG USE.

191
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,600
DOUBT SHE'S HOLDING OUT ON HER
DAYS AS AN ASBESTOS MINER.

192
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,900
CRYOGLOBULINEMIA MIGHT ACCOUNT
FOR THE SYMPTOMS.

193
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,400
EXCEPT FOR
THE ONE YOU MISSED.

194
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,500
THERE'S NO CHANGE
IN HER CONDITION.

195
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,800
I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT A NEW SYMPTOM.

196
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,000
I'M TALKING ABOUT ONE
THAT PRESENTED SIX MONTHS AGO.

197
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,900
LOOK, SHE'S NUTS,
BUT WE CAN'T JUST GIVE HER

198
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,100
10 CCs OF ATHEISM
AND SEND HER HOME.

199
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,100
RELIGION IS A SYMPTOM
OF IRRATIONAL BELIEF

200
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,000
AND GROUNDLESS HOPE.

201
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,200
ALTERED MENTAL STATUS,
ON THE OTHER HAND,

202
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,000
IS A SYMPTOM OF PORPHYRIA.

203
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,900
SHE DIDN'T DEVELOP
UNCONTROLLABLE ANGER,

204
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,100
CRYING, ANXIETY.

205
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,700
SHE JUST DECIDED
TO GO TO TEMPLE.

206
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,500
<i>THE WOMAN DIDN'T JUST
CHOOSE TO KEEP KOSHER.</i>

207
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,200
SHE WENT DIRECTLY
TO THE EXTREMES OF HASIDISM,

208
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,000
A LIFE OF STRINGENT RULES.

209
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,100
SHE BECAME A MASOCHIST.

210
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,000
SHE DIDN'T LIKE HER OLD LIFE,
SO SHE CHANGED IT.

211
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
PEOPLE DON'T CHANGE.

212
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,800
THEY WANT TO.
THEY NEED TO.

213
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,100
TAUB GAVE UP A SIX FIGURE
PLASTIC SURGERY CAREER

214
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:37,500
FOR THIS JOB.

215
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,900
THAT MEAN HE HAS
PORPHYRIA?

216
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,000
HE SWITCHED JOBS
TO SAVE HIS MARRIAGE.

217
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,200
HE DID IT TO AVOID CHANGE.

218
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,400
HE'S RIGHT.

219
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,000
<i>YOU DON'T SUDDENLY
CHOOSE CRAZY</i>

220
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,500
WITHOUT SUDDENLY
BEING CRAZY.

221
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,200
NO, NO, IF SHE WALKED
AWAY FROM EVERYTHING

222
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,000
TO GO BASE JUMPING
OR LIVE WITH APES,

223
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,400
WE WOULDN'T BE HAVING
THIS DISCUSSION.

224
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,100
WE WOULD IF SHE WAS
ALSO TINKLING BLOOD

225
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,000
OUT OF HER OVEREXCITED BLADDER.

226
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,900
PUMP HADASSAH FULL OF HEMATIN
AND GIVE HER A PHLEBOTOMY.

227
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,700
BLOODLETTING?

228
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,100
<i>PORPHYRIA IS A RARE
GENETIC DISORDER</i>

229
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,500
THAT CAUSES AN OVERPRODUCTION
OF A CERTAIN PROTEIN.

230
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,600
DRAINING THE BLOOD
RELIEVES-

231
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,700
THE HAIR TEST
FOR DAMAGE FROM DRUGS

232
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,100
SHOWED SHE HAS
A RARE GENETIC DISEASE?

233
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:19,900
NOT-NOT EXACTLY.

234
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,600
WE'RE TESTING HER NOW
TO CONFIRM.

235
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,700
YOU'RE TREATING IT
BEFORE YOU CONFIRM IT?

236
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,700
<i>BLOOD TEST RESULTS
TAKE 24 HOURS.</i>

237
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,800
YOU MUST HAVE SEEN SOMETHING
THAT MAKES YOU SUSPECT IT.

238
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,000
DR. HOUSE HAS

239
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
A THEORY.

240
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,300
A THEORY BASED ON WHAT?

241
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,900
WE'D LIKE
A DIFFERENT DOCTOR.

242
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,300
I ASSURE YOU
THAT DR. HOUSE IS OUR BEST-

243
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,500
THEN WE WILL SETTLE
FOR SECOND-BEST,

244
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,400
SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T THINK
MY WIFE IS SICK

245
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,500
JUST BECAUSE
SHE'S RELIGIOUS.

246
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,900
<i>IF YOU PREFER,</i>

247
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,800
I CAN GIVE YOUR WIFE
MY SECOND-BEST DIAGNOSIS.

248
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,000
DO YOU KNOW WILSON'S
DATING AMBER?

249
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,500
I HAVE REVIEWED
THE CHART.

250
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,700
SOMEONE ON YOUR TEAM
MUST HAVE POINTED OUT

251
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,600
THAT CRYOGLOBULINEMIA
ALSO FITS THE SYMPTOMS.

252
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,000
<i>YES, IT FITS MANY
OF THE SYMPTOMS.</i>

253
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
<i>MY WIFE'S BODY IS SICK.</i>

254
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,900
HER MIND AND SOUL ARE FINE.

255
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,500
YOU LIVE ACCORDING TO GOD'S
600 COMMITMENTS, RIGHT?

256
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,800
613.

257
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,000
YOU UNDERSTAND THEM ALL?

258
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,000
TAKES A LIFETIME
OF LEARNING...

259
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,900
BUT YOU FOLLOW
THE ONES

260
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,700
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND BECAUSE
THE ONES YOU DO UNDERSTAND

261
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,900
MAKE SENSE, AND YOU BELIEVE

262
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,000
THE GUY WHO CREATED THEM
KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING.

263
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,400
OF COURSE.

264
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,900
SO YOU WILL TRUST
MY DIAGNOSIS

265
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,000
AND YOU'LL LET ME
TREAT HER,

266
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,200
<i>BECAUSE IN THIS TEMPLE,
I AM DR. YAHWEH.</i>

267
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,700
I WANT A NEW DOCTOR.

268
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,700
I'M STARTING HER
ON INDOMETHACIN

269
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,500
FOR CRYOGLOBULINEMIA.

270
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,300
PEOPLE DON'T CHANGE.

271
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,400
FOR EXAMPLE, I'M GONNA KEEP REPEATING
PEOPLE DON'T CHANGE.

272
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,200
SO ALCOHOLICS THAT SUCCESSFULLY

273
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,700
GO THROUGH TREATMENT
DON'T EXIST.

274
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,400
THEY'RE STILL ALCOHOLICS.

275
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,900
IF THEY NEVER TAKE A DRINK
AS LONG AS THEY LIVE,

276
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,800
IT'S ONLY 'CAUSE
THEY DIDN'T LIVE LONG ENOUGH.

277
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,000
IF YOU'RE DISSATISFIED
WITH YOUR LIFE,

278
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,700
CHANGING IT IS A SYMPTOM
OF MENTAL HEALTH.

279
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,600
I GET WHY THAT CONCEPT
IS STRANGE TO YOU.

280
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
O2 SATS ARE 85.

281
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
<i>SHE'S HYPOXIC.
WE MIGHT NEED TO INTUBATE.</i>

282
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,100
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?

283
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,700
IT'S DEFINITELY NOT
CRYOGLOBULINEMIA.

284
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,200
BETTER ASK HIM.

285
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,900
<i>WE KEPT HER
ON OXYGEN OVERNIGHT.</i>

286
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,100
HER RESPIRATORY RATE
STABILIZED,

287
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,200
AND HER O-SAT'S
BACK UP TO 95.

288
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,200
I SAW AMBER DROP OFF WILSON
THIS MORNING.

289
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,000
YES, THE MALE
ALWAYS DRIVES THE FEMALE.

290
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,200
SO WHAT CAUSED
THE BREATHING PROBLEM?

291
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,800
PULMONARY INVOLVEMENT
RULES OUT PORPHYRIA.

292
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,100
SHE KISS HIM OR HE KISS HER?

293
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,000
I MISSED IT.

294
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,200
THE LAB TECH WITH THE TONGUE
STUD ALSO PULLED UP.

295
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,100
WEGENER'S WOULD EXPLAIN
HER ELEVATED SED RATE.

296
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,600
WEGENER'S WOULDN'T EXPLAIN
THE CHANGED MENTAL STATUS.

297
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,700
ACTUALLY, WE'VE
BEEN TRYING TO IGNORE

298
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,300
THAT PART
OF THE WHITEBOARD.

299
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,000
I WROTE IT IN BLACK.

300
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,100
I'M ALWAYS SERIOUS
WHEN I USE BLACK.

301
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,700
- LUPUS WOULD EXPLAIN-
- MAYBE SHE DIDN'T CHANGE.

302
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,100
ARE YOU AGREEING WITH ME
OR YOU MAKING A POINT?

303
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,500
I'M MAKING A POINT.

304
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,600
THAT'S GONNA TAKE LONGER.

305
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,900
<i>HOW DO WE KNOW
THAT THE REAL ROZ</i>

306
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,100
ISN'T WHO SHE IS NOW
AND WHO SHE WAS THEN?

307
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,200
<i>CAN'T WE SAY THAT
HER PREVIOUS LIFE WAS TRUE</i>

308
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,100
WITHOUT MAKING
HER PRESENT ONE A FRAUD?

309
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,900
"LIFE IS MESSY" ARGUMENT.
NICE.

310
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,700
<i>EXPLAINS EVERYTHING
WITHOUT EXPLAINING ANYTHING.</i>

311
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,800
IF IT'S LUPUS,
THERE'S A HEART PROBLEM

312
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,100
<i>WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT YET.</i>

313
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,500
RUN HER THROUGH
A STRESS TEST.

314
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,200
IF SHE HAS A HEART ATTACK,
I'M RIGHT.

315
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,600
OR WE COULD WAIT,
HOPE THAT-

316
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,900
YOU'RE AFRAID
TO GIVE HER A HEART ATTACK.

317
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,900
OF COURSE WE'RE AFRAID-

318
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,100
NO REASON TO BE AFRAID.

319
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,100
UNLESS YOU THINK I'M RIGHT.

320
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,700
IT'S WEGENER'S.

321
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,100
BUT WE'LL HAVE THE CRASH CART
JUST IN CASE.

322
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,200
OH, MY GOD!
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE?

323
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,700
I HAD A SUDDEN YEN
FOR FUSION.

324
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,100
I PUT A DIFFERENT RESTAURANT
IN MY DATE BOOK.

325
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,300
I'M FIRING MY ASSISTANT.

326
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,400
THAT'S OKAY.

327
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,200
HI, GREG.

328
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,500
AND I CALL YOU GREG
BECAUSE WE'RE NOW SOCIAL EQUALS.

329
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,800
I CALL YOU
CUTTHROAT BITCH...

330
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,900
<i>WELL,
QUOD ERAT DEMONSTRANDUM.</i>

331
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,100
AND I SPEAK IN LATIN

332
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,400
BECAUSE I DON'T TRY TO HIDE
WHAT AN ASS I AM.

333
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,100
I ASSUME YOU'D LIKE
TO JOIN US?

334
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,800
IT'LL BE EASIER
TO OBSERVE OUR INTERACTION

335
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,000
IF YOU'RE AT THE SAME TABLE.

336
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,600
IF WE EVER GET SEATED.

337
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,700
EXCUSE ME.

338
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,400
NO, NO, I, UH-

339
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,500
WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR ...

340
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,200
<i>ANY MINUTE NOW,</i>

341
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,500
SHE'S GONNA HIT HIM
IN THE FACE

342
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,000
WITH YOUR TESTICLES.

343
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,700
SHE TENDS TO TREAT E-

344
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,600
SHE TENDS TO TREAT
EVERY EVENT

345
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,700
LIKE IT'S THE LAST COPTER
OUT OF SAIGON.

346
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,400
<i>SHE'S THE ANTI-WILSON.</i>

347
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,000
SHE'S A FORCE
FOR EVIL.

348
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,000
SHE HAS
AN ANNOYING QUALITY.

349
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,200
PERHAPS EVEN TWO.

350
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,000
IF I WAS PERFECT,
I WOULD DATE PERFECT.

351
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,900
YOU LIKE THAT!

352
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,100
IT'S ANNOYING,
BUT SHE'S GOOD AT IT.

353
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,000
WAIT A SECOND.

354
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,300
THIS ISN'T JUST
ABOUT THE SEX.

355
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,100
YOU LIKE HER PERSONALITY.
YOU LIKE THAT SHE'S CONNIVING.

356
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,400
YOU LIKE THAT SHE HAS
NO REGARD FOR CONSEQUENCES.

357
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,600
YOU LIKE THAT SHE CAN
HUMILIATE SOMEONE IF IT SERVES-

358
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,400
OH, MY GOD.

359
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,800
YOU'RE SLEEPING WITH ME.

360
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,300
I NEED YOU TO GO FASTER, ROZ.

361
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,600
A LITTLE HARDER.

362
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,700
I AM GOING HARDER,
DAMN IT.

363
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,600
WHAT IF DR. HOUSE
WAS RIGHT?

364
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,200
AND ROZ DID MAKE
A RADICAL CHANGE?

365
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,400
LUPUS IS CHRONIC
BUT TREATABLE.

366
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,100
AND WITH THE TREATMENT,
IT'D UNDO THE CHANGE?

367
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,400
SHE'LL BE THE WAY SHE WAS
BEFORE I KNEW HER?

368
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,100
I DON'T THINK IT'S LIKELY.

369
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,700
THEN YOU DON'T KNOW FOR SURE.

370
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,400
YOU'D FIND SOMEONE ELSE.

371
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,800
THERE ISN'T SOMEONE ELSE.

372
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,100
YOU'VE HAD THREE DATES.

373
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,700
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN MARRIED?

374
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,900
12 YEARS.

375
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,400
AND IS SHE THE ONE?

376
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,700
WE WOULDN'T STILL BE TOGETHER
IF SHE WEREN'T.

377
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,300
I LOVE HER AS MUCH NOW
AS THE DAY-

378
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,000
<i>WELL, YOU SHOULD
LOVE HER MORE.</i>

379
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,500
THE MORE YOU KNOW SOMEONE,

380
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,200
THE MORE YOU
SHOULD LOVE THEM.

381
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,800
OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH, ROZ.

382
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,500
OKAY, YOUR HEART'S
AS STRONG AS A BATTLESHIP.

383
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,300
<i>DOES THIS MEAN
DR. HOUSE WAS WRONG?</i>

384
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,200
OH! OH, MY LEG!

385
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,600
HEART'S STRONG ENOUGH
TO PROVE YOU WRONG

386
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,400
ABOUT THE CHANGE
IN MENTAL STATUS.

387
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,900
ONLY PROVES
THIS ISN'T LUPUS.

388
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,000
JUST AS THE LEG PAIN PROVES
IT ISN'T WEGENER'S.

389
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,700
LEG PAIN CAN BE
FROM NERVE ENTRAPMENT.

390
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,900
WE'RE THINKING
BLOOD CLOT.

391
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,900
DO AN MRI
TO LOOK FOR THE CLOT.

392
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,600
THEN DO AN fMRI.

393
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,300
- AN MRI ALONE ...
- IF THE CLOT HASN'T DISSOLVED.

394
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,800
AN fMRI CAN SHOW SIGNS
OF NEAR-ISCHEMIC STROKE

395
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,600
IN POST-ISCHEMIC PARTS
OF THE BRAIN.

396
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,600
- GIVE ME TEN BUCKS.
- NO.

397
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,500
I MISSED LUNCH.

398
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,800
- I THOUGHT YOU WENT-
- I MISSED LUNCH.

399
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,300
GOOD SYMMETRICAL ACTIVITY
IN BOTH HEMISPHERES.

400
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,400
CAUDAL STRUCTURES LOOK OKAY.

401
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,500
SHE HASN'T CHANGED?

402
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,000
<i>SEX, DRUGS,
ROCK AND ROLL,</i>

403
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,300
THE 600 RULES OF GOD
ARE ALL IN THERE SOMEWHERE.

404
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,000
WE OVERSIMPLIFY PEOPLE.

405
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,900
<i>IT'S HOW
THE HUMAN MIND WORKS.</i>

406
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,900
<i>EVERYTHING'S
ON OR OFF.</i>

407
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,900
EVERYTHING'S GOT A CATEGORY.

408
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,500
YOU DON'T LIKE IT.

409
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,200
YOU DON'T WANNA BE
OVERSIMPLIFIED.

410
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,400
ROZ, MOVE YOUR RIGHT LEG.

411
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,900
NO ONE CAN DESCRIBE THEMSELVES
IN TEN WORDS.

412
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,700
WHY WOULD WE WANT TO HEAR
ANYONE ELSE DO IT?

413
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,200
SO YOU KEEP IT A MYSTERY.

414
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,100
NO CATEGORIES
IF NO ONE KNOWS ANYTHING.

415
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,000
DO YOU THINK MAYBE
YOU'RE OVERSIMPLIFYING ME NOW?

416
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,100
NO.

417
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,600
I'M SURE YOU HAVE
MANY REASONS

418
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,900
TO KEEP YOURSELF A MYSTERY,

419
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,700
BESIDES THE FACT
THAT YOU'RE BISEXUAL.

420
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:04,200
UH... DENIAL WOULD HAVE WORKED
BEFORE THE LONG, VACANT STARE.

421
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,400
ROZ, MOVE YOUR LEFT LEG
JUST AN INCH.

422
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,500
PEOPLE WHO HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH BOXES

423
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,200
ARE PEOPLE
WHO DON'T FIT IN THEM.

424
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,300
YOU'VE BEEN WORKING
FOR HOUSE FOR A LONG TIME.

425
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,700
NO NEED FOR NAME CALLING.

426
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,100
I WOULD ASK IF THIS
WAS GONNA BE LUNCHTIME GOSSIP,

427
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,000
BUT LUCKY FOR ME-

428
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,400
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN.

429
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,000
HOW'S OUR MENTAL YENTL?

430
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,900
MRI SHOWS NO SIGN
OF CLOTS.

431
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,500
<i>fMRI SHOWS
NO PROBLEM AREAS.</i>

432
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,100
GO RESTART HER IV.

433
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,400
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT?
- NOTHING.

434
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,200
BUT LIKE SO MANY PROCEDURES
WE PUT PATIENTS THROUGH,

435
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,400
IT HURTS.

436
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,200
WHICH, IF SHE'S ENJOYING IT,
WILL SHOW UP IN PRETTY COLORS.

437
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,800
THIS IS WHY YOU WANTED
AN fMRI?

438
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,300
IT SHOWED SHE DIDN'T
HAVE A BLOOD CLOT,

439
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,100
<i>WHICH IS DIAGNOSTICALLY
RELEVANT.</i>

440
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,100
AND IT CAN SHOW
IF SHE'S BECOME A MASOCHIST-

441
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,000
ALSO DIAGNOSTICALLY RELEVANT.

442
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,300
AND IT'LL BE COOL.

443
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,400
EITHER WILL EXPLAIN WHICH PART 
OF MY ANALYSIS MAKES SENSE.

444
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,900
OR GO DO IT.

445
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,900
IT ISN'T COOL.

446
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,800
I'M SORRY.

447
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,500
<i>HEAVENS.
LOOK AT HER LIMBIC SYSTEM.</i>

448
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,400
<i>PLEASURE CENTERS ARE LIGHTING
UP LIKE A HANUKAH BUSH.</i>

449
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,900
FOREMAN MUST HAVE
A TOUCH LIKE AN ELEPHANT.

450
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,000
OKAY, ROZ.
WE'VE GOT WHAT WE NEED.

451
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,700
YES, IT WAS IMPRESSIVE.

452
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,900
ROZ.

453
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,300
YOU ALL RIGHT?

454
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,800
I'M SORRY.
I WAS PRAYING.

455
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,100
ALL THROUGH
THE PROCEDURE?

456
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,000
NO.

457
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,600
WHEN DR. FOREMAN
APOLOGIZED,

458
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,800
I KNEW SOMETHING BAD
WAS GONNA HAPPEN.

459
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,300
SHE WAS PRAYING.

460
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,000
<i>COULD EXPLAIN
THE BRAIN ACTIVITY.</i>

461
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,300
BP, ND HEART RATE
ARE DROPPING.

462
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,000
SHE'S CRASHING.

463
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,300
SHE'S STABILIZING.

464
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,700
GET HER UP.

465
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,300
ALL THE WAY UP.
ON HER FEET.

466
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,600
MAKE HER DO THAT AGAIN.

467
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,800
WE STARTED HER ON
FLUDROCORTISONE AND EPHEDRINE.

468
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,100
<i>IT'S PLANET OF THE APES.</i>

469
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,000
APES ARE THE HUMANS,
HUMANS ARE THE APES.

470
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
<i>IT'S WACKY WEDNESDAY,
OPPOSITE DAY.</i>

471
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,600
<i>WHEN YOU STAND UP,</i>

472
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,400
YOUR BP AND HEART RATE
ARE SUPPOSED TO GO UP, NOT-

473
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,400
GOT IT.

474
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,300
SO WHAT CAUSES BLOODY URINE,

475
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
LOSS OF BLADDER CONTROL,
LEG PAIN, ALTERED MENTAL STATUS,

476
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,600
AND PRESSURE-BLOOD
IN DIRECTION-WRONG?

477
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,100
PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA.

478
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,500
LOW CATECHOLAMINES
IN THE URINE

479
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,700
MEANS NO PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA
IN THE JEWESS.

480
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,500
COULD BE
SYSTEMIC SCLEROSIS.

481
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,700
MENTAL STATUS.

482
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,900
SHE WAS PRAYING.

483
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,500
SHE WAS IN PAIN.
YOU NO LONGER THINK SHE'S CRAZY?

484
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:27,800
I CAN SEE WHY SHE'D BE ATTRACTED
TO THAT LIFE.

485
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,000
YOU DRANK THE
MANISHEVITZ-FLAVORED KOOL-AID.

486
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,300
I'M NOT SAYING I AGREE.
I'M JUST SAYING-

487
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,600
THAT THERE'S A RATIONAL BASIS
FOR THE IRRATIONAL.

488
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,600
THEY HAVE SOMETHING
WE DON'T HAVE.

489
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,700
IMAGINARY FRIENDS.

490
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,900
IF THE TOASTER'S NOT WORKING,
WIRING COULD BE BAD.

491
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,000
WHICH DEBATE IS THAT METAPHOR
SUPPOSED TO HELP US WITH?

492
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,200
ELECTRICAL PROBLEM
IN THE HEART.

493
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,000
<i>ARRHYTHMIA MESSES WITH
THE BLOOD FLOW WHEN SHE STANDS,</i>

494
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,300
<i>CAUSES LOW BP AND HEART RATE.</i>

495
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,900
COULD ALSO IMPACT
MENTAL STATUS.

496
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,000
EVERYBODY'S HAPPY.

497
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,100
RUN AN EP STUDY OF HER HEART.

498
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,900
<i>FIND WHERE THE WIRING'S
VERKLEMPT.</i>

499
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,200
WENT BY YOUR HOTEL
THIS MORNING.

500
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,600
THEY TOLD ME
YOU MOVED OUT.

501
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,000
MOVED IN WITH C.B.?

502
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
NO, APPARENTLY,
I MOVED IN WITH YOU.

503
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,900
THE VERY FACT
THAT YOU'RE RESISTING MY INSIGHT

504
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,800
PROVES TO ME-

505
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,000
HOUSE, YOU'RE RIGHT.

506
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,300
WHY NOT?
WHY NOT DATE YOU?

507
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,700
IT'S BRILLIANT.

508
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,100
WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER
FOR YEARS,

509
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,300
WE'VE PUT UP WITH ALL KINDS
OF CRAP FROM EACH OTHER,

510
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,000
AND WE KEEP COMING BACK.

511
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,400
WE'RE A COUPLE.

512
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,000
ARE WE STILL SPEAKING
METAPHORICALLY?

513
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,400
<i>AMBER IS EXACTLY
WHAT I NEED</i>

514
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,200
AND YOU WOULD AGREE IF YOU
WEREN'T MIRED IN SELF-LOATHING

515
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,400
TOPPED WITH A THIN CRUST
OF MEGALOMANIA.

516
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,400
HEY. THAT'S MY BEST FRIEND'S
GIRL YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

517
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,300
I WAS WRONG.

518
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,200
HOUSE, YOU'RE RIGHT.

519
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,400
SHE'S NOT ME.
WELL, SHE IS ME.

520
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,900
BUT THAT'S NOT WHY
SHE'S ATTRACTIVE.

521
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,300
SHE'S A NEEDY VERSION
OF ME.

522
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,100
HARD TO IMAGINE
SUCH A MYTHICAL CREATURE.

523
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,700
YOU STARTED SEEING HER
RIGHT AFTER I FIRED HER.

524
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,900
I STARTED SEEING HER
FOUR MONTHS AGO.

525
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
SHE TOLD KUTNER
IT WAS FOUR WEEKS.

526
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,800
YOU LIED TO ME.

527
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,200
THERE WAS MONEY
ON THE LINE.

528
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,400
BECAUSE I KNEW
HOW YOU'D REACT,

529
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,000
AND I KNEW YOU
WOULDN'T PAY ME ANYWAY.

530
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,300
YOU KNEW THAT I WAS RIGHT.

531
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,000
SHE WASN'T NEEDY.

532
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,100
SHE WAS IN A...
BAD SITUATION.

533
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,300
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE.

534
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,100
NOT TO YOUR LIBIDO.

535
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,900
WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

536
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,500
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

537
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,100
EVERY TIME I AGREE WITH YOU,
YOU FIND A NEW ARGUMENT.

538
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,800
WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO AVOID?

539
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,600
WELL, IF YOU'D LOOKED AT ME
WITH THOSE FLASHING EYES

540
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,300
BEFORE I WAS INVOLVED...

541
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,500
<i>C'EST LA VIE.</i>

542
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,600
AND... I USE
THE FRENCH BECAUSE...

543
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,000
YOU'RE AN ASS.

544
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,600
RIGHT ATRIUM NORMAL,
NO ARRHYTHMIA.

545
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,800
YOU CAN BECOME
A D'HAR MASTER.

546
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,600
DOES THAT REQUIRE
FURTHER EXPLANATION?

547
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,600
RIGHT VENTRICLE NORMAL.

548
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,700
IN COLLEGE, I WAS REALLY
INTO SCIENCE FICTION-

549
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,200
NOT LIKE THE GUYS
WITH THE $600 PROSTHETIC EARS

550
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,200
WHO COULD SWEAR IN ROMULAN,

551
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,900
THAT WAS EMBARRASSING
TO THE REST OF US

552
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,900
WHO JUST THOUGHT IT WAS
GOOD, SMART LITERATURE.

553
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,300
WENT TO ONE CONVENTION.

554
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,000
BY SENIOR YEAR, I WAS D'HAR
MASTER IN THE KLINGON EMPIRE.

555
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,300
I'M NOT GONNA BECOME
HASIDIC.

556
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,700
I'M NOT EVEN GONNA BECOME
SLIGHTLY MORE REFORMED.

557
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,800
CORONARY SINUS NORMAL.

558
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,800
YOU CAN'T HAVE YOUR EYES OPENED
TO SOMETHING AND NOT ACT ON IT.

559
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,600
I HAVEN'T HAD
MY EYES OPENED.

560
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,200
I JUST... DON'T THINK
THEY'RE CRAZY ANYMORE.

561
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,800
THEN THEY HAVE
SOMETHING TO OFFER.

562
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:20,700
SHE'S LIVING PROOF

563
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,500
<i>THAT SANE PEOPLE
CAN MAKE RADICAL CHANGES.</i>

564
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,600
BUT HOUSE, HE THINKS
THAT HE CAN BULLY-

565
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,600
<i>NO LOSHON HORA.</i>

566
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,500
I'M SORRY?

567
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,900
I THINK SHE'S TELLING YOU
TO STOP DEFLECTING.

568
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,000
<i>NO LOSHON HORA.</i>

569
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,800
<i>EVIL TONGUE.</i>

570
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,800
GOSSIP.

571
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,400
IT'S OKAY.

572
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,500
THANKS TO THE SEDATIVE,
YOU WON'T REMEMBER IT.

573
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,000
WORDS ARE PERMANENT.

574
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,900
<i>SOMEDAY YOU'LL SAY SOMETHING</i>

575
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,100
THAT YOU'LL WISH
YOU COULD TAKE BACK.

576
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,400
THIS BUNDLE'S NORMAL.

577
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,000
PATHWAYS ARE ALL CLEAN.
NO ARRHYTHMIAS.

578
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,300
IF THE TOASTER DOESN'T WORK

579
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,700
AND THE WIRING
IN THE HOUSE IS FINE,

580
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,400
PROBLEM'S GOTTA BE
IN THE CITY'S POWER GRID.

581
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,000
AUTONOMIC NERVE DISORDER
COULD BE RILEY-DAY SYNDROME.

582
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,600
CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR WEDDING.

583
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,700
YOU HAVE A RARE AND INCURABLE
DEGENERATIVE DISEASE.

584
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,900
I'LL SET UP FOR
A THERMOREGULATORY SWEAT TEST.

585
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,600
SHE'S A BISEXUAL.

586
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,100
WHAT?

587
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:13,500
I COULD HEAR THEM TALKING
FROM INSIDE THE MRI.

588
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,600
HEAR WHO?
I HEARD THE WORD SEX.

589
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,200
<i>- IT WAS INTERESTING.
- WHAT WAS INTERESTING?</i>

590
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,200
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

591
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:19,700
WE'RE DOCTORS.

592
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,800
WE NEVER KNOW
WHAT'S GONNA MATTER.

593
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,900
SHE SAID SEX.

594
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,900
IF SHE WANTS TO TELL YOU
WHEN SHE WAKES UP...

595
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,100
YEAH, THESE PEOPLE
AREN'T GONNA CHANGE YOU AT ALL.

596
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,500
I NEED YOU TO SLEEP
WITH WILSON.

597
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,700
GOOD MORNING.

598
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,900
HE'S INVOLVED
WITH AN INAPPROPRIATE WOMAN.

599
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,200
HIS PEOPLE ARE SHEEPHERDERS
AND AMBER'S ARE CATTLEMEN?

600
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,800
HE'S COMBINING TWO
OF HIS WORST QUALITIES-

601
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,800
HIS LOVE FOR ME
AND HIS LOVE FOR NEED.

602
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,400
<i>AS ADMINISTRATOR
OF THIS HOSPITAL,</i>

603
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,800
YOU HAVE TO SAVE
YOUR STAR ONCOLOGIST.

604
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,300
WISH I COULD HELP,
BUT AS ADMINISTRATOR,

605
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,500
THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE
IN ACCOUNTING

606
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,700
I'M SCHEDULED
TO SLEEP WITH FIRST.

607
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,700
WILSON HAS A PATTERN
WITH WOMEN.

608
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,600
<i>HE SAVES THEM,
THEN HE BETRAYS THEM,</i>

609
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,300
WHICH THEN CAUSES GUILT...

610
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,000
WHICH THEN CAUSES HIM
TO GO SAVE SOMEBODY ELSE.

611
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
FOR EXAMPLE, A HOSPITAL
BUREAUCRAT NEARING 40

612
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,300
WHO HAS NO PERSONAL LIFE.

613
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,900
I SUGGEST
YOU GO BRALESS.

614
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,600
I GET THAT "SLEEP WITH"
IS YOUR WAY OF SAYING

615
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,200
I SHOULD TALK TO HIM?

616
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,800
NO. I REALLY MEAN
SLEEP WITH.

617
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,300
YOU'RE NOT WORRIED

618
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,400
YOU'RE WORRIED
IT'LL SUCCEED.

619
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,100
THAT WILSON WILL NO LONGER BE
AT YOUR BECK AND CALL 24/7.

620
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,800
THAT YOUR BEST FRIEND
WILL CHANGE.

621
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,500
PEOPLE DON'T CHANGE JUST
BECAUSE THEY WISH THEY COULD.

622
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,000
AND IT BUGS YOU
THAT HE WISHES HE COULD!

623
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,300
YOU'LL NEVER LOSE
YOUR FRIEND, HOUSE.

624
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,600
YOU'RE THE LONG-DISTANCE RUNNER
OF NEEDINESS.

625
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,200
<i>AS THE CHAMBER HEATS UP,</i>

626
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,200
<i>ROZ'S BODY TEMPERATURE
SHOULD ALSO RISE,</i>

627
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,900
MAKING HER SWEAT
AND TURNING THE POWDER PURPLE.

628
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,100
NO CHANGE IN COLOR
MEANS NO SWEATING,

629
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,900
WHICH MEANS HER CENTRAL
NERVOUS SYSTEM IS DAMAGED.

630
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,300
I SHOULDN'T
SEE HER LIKE THIS.

631
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,300
WE COULD HAVE A DIAGNOSIS

632
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,700
AS SOON AS SHE COMES
OUT OF THE CHAMBER.

633
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,800
IT MIGHT BE BETTER
IF YOU STAYED.

634
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,300
IT'S DISRESPECTFUL.

635
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,700
I'M SURE SURE SHE IMAGINED

636
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,800
<i>THE FIRST TIME
HER HUSBAND WOULD SEE HER</i>

637
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,800
BARE LIKE THIS WOULD BE
CELEBRATING THE MARRIAGE.

638
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,200
GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES,

639
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,900
I THINK ROZ
WOULD SACRIFICE MODESTY

640
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,300
TO HAVE YOU WITH HER.

641
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
PLEASE.
DON'T DO THAT.

642
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,000
WHAT? I THINK IT'S NICE
THAT YOU'RE HERE.

643
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,800
- I THINK-
- YOU THINK IT'S SWEET...

644
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,400
THAT I CARE FOR HER MODESTY,

645
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,100
BUT THAT IT'S ARCHAIC
AND ULTIMATELY IRRELEVANT.

646
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,800
OUR TRADITIONS
AREN'T JUST BLIND RITUALS.

647
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,900
THEY... THEY MEAN SOMETHING.

648
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,100
THEY HAVE PURPOSE.

649
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,600
I RESPECT MY WIFE.

650
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,400
AND I RESPECT HER BODY.

651
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,200
HER BODY TEMPERATURE'S
STOPPED CLIMBING.

652
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,200
WHAT'S GOING ON?

653
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,300
SHE'S HAVING A SEIZURE!
WE NEED A CRASH CART!

654
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,000
BLANKETS TOO!
SHE'S FREEZING.

655
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:59,400
<i>SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO SWEAT
AND SHE FROZE.</i>

656
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,600
<i>RETURN TO THE PLANET
OF THE APES.</i>

657
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,500
HYPOTHERMIA CAUSED THE SEIZURE.

658
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,200
WHAT CAUSED THE HYPOTHERMIA?

659
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,400
<i>IT COULD BE AN INFECTION.</i>

660
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,000
<i>HER WHITE BLOOD CELL
COUNT WAS FINE.</i>

661
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,700
WHEN SHE WAS ADMITTED.

662
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,100
SHE COULD HAVE PICKED
SOMETHING UP HERE.

663
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,000
COMPLICATION
ON A COMPLICATION?

664
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,800
BODY'S DOING THE OPPOSITE
OF WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO.

665
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,000
HER BODY'S WILSON.

666
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,700
HOW DO WE RESPOND TO THAT?

667
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,300
WE ACCEPT
THAT HE'S HAPPY.

668
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,500
WE DO THE OPPOSITE.

669
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,500
SO YOU WANT US TO WHAT,
SEND THE PATIENT HOME?

670
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,100
INFECTION... MEANS THAT

671
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,500
SOMETHING'S BEEN ADDED
TO THE BODY,

672
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,400
SOMETHING THAT SHOULD
BE EXPELLED.

673
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,900
WHAT'S THE OPPOSITE
OF THAT?

674
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,600
SOMETHING MISSING
FROM THE BODY.

675
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,300
COULD BE AN ENZYME
OR A HORMONE.

676
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,300
CORTISOL.
COULD BE ADDISON'S.

677
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,900
IT FITS.

678
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,100
EVERY SYMPTOM.

679
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,200
I'LL RUN A CORTISOL
STIMULATION TEST.

680
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
ARE YOU SURE
SHE DOESN'T WANNA JUST

681
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,500
TAKE YOU BACK TO HER LAIR,
HANG YOU UPSIDE DOWN,

682
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,100
AND DEPOSIT HER EGGS
IN YOU?

683
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,400
EXCELLENT DISGUISE,
HOUSE.

684
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,400
YOU TWO ARE REALLY
THAT SERIOUS?

685
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,300
SHE'S PRETTY.
SHE'S FUNNY.

686
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,800
- MAYBE SHE'S A LITTLE MORE... 
- EVIL?

687
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,800
AGGRESSIVE THAN
YOU'D EXPECT FROM ME.

688
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,300
BUT I'M HAPPY.

689
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,000
CAN'T I JUST ENJOY WHAT
THAT FEELS LIKE FOR A WHILE?

690
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,000
HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE LOOKED
AT YOU TRUSTINGLY

691
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,100
WHILE YOU GAVE THEM
A FATAL PROGNOSIS,

692
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,200
BUT YOU KNEW IT WAS KINDER
TO TELL THEM THE TRUTH?

693
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,500
AMBER COMPULSIVELY LOOKS OUT
FOR NUMBER ONE.

694
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,800
YOU COMPULSIVELY LOOK OUT
FOR THE PERSON THAT YOU'RE WITH.

695
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
YOUR NEEDS ARE GONNA FEED
HER NEEDS

696
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,400
UNTIL ALL THAT'S LEFT
IS A WILSON CHALK OUTLINE

697
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,800
ON THE FLOOR.

698
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,600
SORRY.

699
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,300
WOW!

700
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,500
THAT CORTISOL STUFF
IS GREAT.

701
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,300
DOES IT WORK
ON EVERYTHING?

702
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,800
I TAKE IT
YOU'RE FEELING BETTER.

703
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,400
OH, STILL WEAK.

704
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,800
<i>BUT YEAH.</i>

705
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,100
YOU MUST BE SO TIRED.

706
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,300
YOU SHOULD GO HOME
AND GET SOME SLEEP.

707
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,400
I'LL STAY.

708
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:06,600
I NEVER TOLD YOU,
BUT YOU ARE MUCH BETTER LOOKING

709
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,800
THAN MRS. SILVER
LED ME TO EXPECT.

710
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,800
<i>SHE NEVER LIKED ME.</i>

711
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,400
WHEN I WAS EIGHT,

712
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,600
I THREW UP ON HER SHOES
AT MY UNCLE'S WEDDING.

713
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,800
YOUR ABDOMEN'S
A LITTLE SWOLLEN.

714
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,400
MM?

715
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,400
IS IT SERIOUS?

716
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,300
IT'S HARD TO SAY.

717
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,800
SOMETIMES IT CAN MEAN
A LIVER ISSUE.

718
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,400
- WE'LL HAVE TO TEST.
- OH...

719
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,100
OH, DIZZINESS
IS GETTING-

720
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,700
SHE'S GOING INTO SHOCK.

721
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,200
I NEED ANOTHER LITER OF SALINE.
TYPE AND CROSS TWO UNITS.

722
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,500
WHAT'S HAPPENING
TO HER?

723
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,900
SHE'S BLEEDING INTERNALLY.

724
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,100
<i>SHE'S SAYING THE SHEMA.</i>

725
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,000
SHE THINKS SHE'S DYING.

726
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,600
THE MRI SHOWS
YOU'RE BLEEDING INTERNALLY,

727
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,500
BUT NOT WHERE
IT'S COMING FROM.

728
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,100
THE BLOOD CAN ONLY
KEEP YOU STABLE FOR SO LONG.

729
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:54,700
OUR BEST OPTION
IS TO OPEN YOU UP AND SEARCH.

730
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,100
BUT YOU CAN FIX IT?

731
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,900
IF WE FIND THE LEAK.

732
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,200
YOU FIND THE BLEEDING,
YOU FIND THE DISEASE?

733
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,700
NO.

734
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,800
BUT IT COULD KEEP YOU ALIVE
LONG ENOUGH

735
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,500
SO DR. HOUSE CAN FIND
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU.

736
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,300
NO.

737
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,500
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
THE SURGERY...

738
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,300
IT'S THE ONLY CHANCE
YOU'VE GOT.

739
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,900
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
THE SURGERY

740
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,900
UNTIL AFTER SUNSET.

741
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I'M PROBABLY
GONNA DIE ANYWAY.

742
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:34,100
I JUST WANNA SHARE
ONE SHABBAT WITH MY HUSBAND.

743
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,500
ROZ, PLEASE.

744
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:45,000
THE TORAH COMMANDS US
TO PRESERVE LIFE.

745
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,100
I WAITED 38 YEARS
TO FIND WHAT I WANTED.

746
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,000
I CAN WAIT
ANOTHER EIGHT HOURS.

747
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,400
I'LL LEAVE THE REST
TO GOD, OKAY?

748
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,300
I HAD A RABBI CALL.

749
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,700
SHE'S ADAMANT.

750
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,900
SHE'S NOT A MASOCHIST.

751
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,300
SHE'S SUICIDAL.

752
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,100
NICE WORK, CHASE.

753
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,600
YEAH. I SHOULD HAVE
HAD TWIN RABBIS CALL.

754
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,500
CAN I GO?

755
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,700
WE NEED YOU.

756
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,200
SO INSTEAD OF A FEW DAYS
WE NOW HAVE A FEW HOURS

757
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,500
TO FIGURE THIS OUT.

758
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,900
- NICE WORK, CHASE.
- WHY DO YOU NEED ME?

759
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,500
SAYING, "NICE WORK, CHASE"
WHEN YOU'RE NOT HERE

760
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,800
<i>IS POINTLESS.</i>

761
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,400
SERIOUSLY, WE NEED YOU.

762
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,800
WE SHOULD X-RAY
FOR MALFORMATIONS OF THE RIB

763
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,300
THAT COULD CAUSE
ARTERIAL TWISTING.

764
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,400
MALFORMATIONS DON'T CAUSE
BLOODY URINE.

765
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,800
SHE'S NOT SUICIDAL.

766
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,200
<i>SHE MADE A COMMITMENT
TO A NEW LIFE WITH HER HUSBAND</i>

767
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,300
AND SHE WANTS ONE MEANINGFUL
EXPERIENCE IN THAT LIFE.

768
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,200
<i>- SHE JUST MET THE GUY.
- TAUB JUST MET HER.</i>

769
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,200
AND HE'S ALREADY SO IN LOVE,
HE'S READY TO LET HER DIE

770
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,500
<i>AND TAKE HER BACK
TO THE HOME PLANET</i>

771
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,900
FOR A BURIAL
IN THE LAVA SEA OF TORMIAD.

772
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,200
IT'S WHO HE MIGHT BE.

773
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,400
SHE'S CONNECTING WITH ALL
THE YEARS SHE'S NOT GONNA HAVE.

774
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,000
BETTER WAY OF CONNECTING
TO THOSE YEARS

775
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,500
IS TO ACTUALLY HAVE THEM.

776
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,000
YOU WANT MORE TIME?

777
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,100
JOSHUA GOT GOD TO MAKE
THE SUN STAND STILL.

778
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,500
NO REASON
GOD CAN'T SPEED IT UP.

779
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,900
AND, BY GOD,
I OF COURSE MEAN YOU.

780
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,200
TOLD YOU
WE NEEDED YOU.

781
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,300
IT'S SUNDOWN, ROZ.

782
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,600
WE'RE TAKING YOU BACK
TO YOUR ROOM

783
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,000
FOR YOUR CANDLELIGHT
DINNER.

784
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,400
READY?
ONE, TWO THREE.

785
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,000
IT'S TOO EARLY.

786
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,300
YOUR SENSE OF TIME IS OFF
BECAUSE OF THE MEDICATION.

787
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,200
<i>GOOD SHABBOS, ROZ.</i>

788
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,000
SO YOU PRAY,
SCARF DOWN SOME CHALLAH,

789
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,400
THEN WE CAN DO THIS?

790
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,100
<i>YOU WANTED
TO SEE ME?</i>

791
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,800
AND YOU CAME.

792
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,500
I FEEL PRETTY CONFIDENT

793
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,100
IT'LL BE
SOMETHING INTERESTING.

794
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,100
SOLVIS CASE
AND THE JOB IS YOURS.

795
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,500
IS THERE A "DROP WILSON" CLAUSE
ATTACHED TO THIS?

796
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,800
STANDARD CONTRACT
ALL EMPLOYEES SIGN.

797
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,000
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE
I HAVE AN ULTERIOR MOTIVE?

798
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,300
FOR THE SAME REASON
I BELIEVE

799
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:02,900
THAT CRACK WHORES
CAN HAVE SEX FOR CRACK.

800
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,200
ALL MY LIFE

801
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,900
I THOUGHT
I HAD TO CHOOSE

802
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:15,200
BETWEEN LOVE
AND RESPECT.

803
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,000
AND I CHOSE RESPECT.

804
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,300
AND WITH WILSON...

805
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,300
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO HAVE BOTH.

806
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,200
AND THAT BEATS
A FELLOWSHIP.

807
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,000
COULD BE D.I.C.

808
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,200
YOU'VE CHANGED.

809
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,200
I HOPE SO.

810
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:02,200
NORMAL PLATELET COUNT
RULES OUT D.I.C.

811
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,600
GOOD TRY THOUGH.

812
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,800
I READ THAT A HYDATID CYST
COULD-

813
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,400
WOULD AFFECT THE LUNGS,
NOT THE BLADDER.

814
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,200
TESTED HER WHITE CELL
COUNT AGAIN.

815
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,300
NORMAL.

816
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,900
HOW LONG TILL WE
GET TO CUT HER OPEN?

817
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,800
<i>WHEN I LEFT, HE WAS STILL
SINGING ESHET SOMETHING.</i>

818
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,700
THE HUSBAND'S BLESSING
OF HIS WIFE.

819
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,400
WOMAN OF VALOR.

820
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,800
"STRENGTH AND HONOR
ARE HER CLOTHING.

821
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,500
SHE LAUGHS AT THE FUTURE."

822
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,500
BECAUSE SHE'S AN IDIOT.

823
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,600
VOLVULUS OF THE SMALL INTESTINE
COULD CAUSE BLEEDING.

824
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,400
SHE WOULD HAVE HAD
CONSTIPATION.

825
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,700
HER VALUE
ISN'T "BEYOND PEARLS" EITHER.

826
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,500
'CAUSE DEAD PEOPLE
HAVE NO VALUE.

827
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,000
POLYCYTHEMIA VERA.

828
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,700
RBC COUNT WOULD BE HIGHER.

829
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,600
I NEED TO BRING
THE LIGHT TO MY FACE.

830
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
THROMBOCYTOPENIA.
IF IT'S AUTOIMMUNE-

831
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,300
TITERS WERE NORMAL.

832
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,100
PARKINSON'S WOULD EXPLAIN
THE HYPOTHERMIA.

833
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,500
<i>NOT THE BLOODY URINE.</i>

834
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,200
THE WOMAN'S NOT JUST
A MASOCHIST, SHE'S A HYPOCRITE.

835
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,600
THE COMMANDMENT
TO PRESERVE LIFE

836
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,300
COMES BEFORE ALL OTHERS.

837
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,400
<i>ACTUALLY MEANS SHE'S
NOT A MASOCHIST.</i>

838
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,100
<i>SHE'S NOT FOLLOWING
ALL THE RULES,</i>

839
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,200
JUST THE ONES
THAT PLEASE HER.

840
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,700
RIGHT, SHE WALKED IN CRAZY

841
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,400
AND EXPLAINED HOW RITUAL
TRUMPS LIVING,

842
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,500
AND YOU DECIDE
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL LIFESTYLE.

843
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,400
I KNOW.
SHE'S WRONG.

844
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,200
BUT IF THERE'S
NOTHING MORE-

845
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,900
THEN THE ONLY MEANING
IS HERE.

846
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,300
BUT IF SHE THINKS
GOD IS THERE FOR HER,

847
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:13,100
IF SHE LIVES HER LIFE
BELIEVING THAT GOD IS THERE-

848
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,400
THEN SHE DIES.

849
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,400
THINGS AREN'T WHERE
WE WANT THEM TO BE

850
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,100
JUST BECAUSE
WE WANT THEM TO BE THERE.

851
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,000
OF COURSE, THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THEY'RE WHERE THEY SHOULD BE.

852
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,300
HEY!

853
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,100
<i>STOP THAT JEW.</i>

854
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,900
<i>CHASE HATES WORKING
ON SHABBOS.</i>

855
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,100
GONNA MAKE THIS EASIER FOR HIM.
STAND HER UP.

856
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,500
SHE DOESN'T DO SO WELL
ON HER FEET.

857
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,500
<i>NEITHER DO I.
STAND HER UP.</i>

858
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,400
<i>YOU CAN TELL ALL THE LADIES
AT THE MIKVAH ABOUT THIS.</i>

859
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,300
WHAT DID YOU DO?

860
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,000
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

861
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,800
PUT YOUR HAND HERE.

862
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:18,700
PRESS HARD.

863
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,200
YOU HAVE NEPHROPTOSIS.

864
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,900
<i>ALSO KNOWN AS
"FLOATING KIDNEY."</i>

865
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,500
THE KIDNEY'S
LIKE A CHANDELIER.

866
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,900
IT'S ATTACHED TO A CEILING OF
INTESTINES AND BLOOD VESSELS.

867
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,100
BUT YOUR CONTRACTOR-
THINK YOU KNOW WHO HE IS-

868
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,700
HE HUNG IT
WITH A CHEAP CHAIN.

869
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,900
IT'S BEEN HANGING SLOPPY
FOR YEARS.

870
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,300
FINALLY SOMETHING
SHOOK IT LOOSE.

871
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,700
<i>AFTER THAT,
EVERY TIME YOU STOOD,</i>

872
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,800
YOUR KIDNEY DROPPED
A FEW CENTIMETERS,

873
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,200
CAUSED ALL YOUR SYMPTOMS.

874
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,500
NONE OF THE SCANS
PICKED IT UP.

875
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,700
BECAUSE WE DO SCANS
WITH PATIENTS LYING DOWN.

876
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,600
<i>SHE'D HAVE BEEN LYING DOWN
IN SURGERY TOO.</i>

877
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,800
NEVER HAVE FOUND IT.

878
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,500
GOOD CHANCE
SHE'D NEVER COME OUT.

879
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,400
SHE'LL BE ALL RIGHT?

880
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,900
ULTRASOUND TO CONFIRM,

881
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,500
THEN TELL CHASE TO PUT
THE KIDNEY BACK ON THE SHELF.

882
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,200
THE BLEED WILL BE NEARBY.

883
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,200
THAT'S... IT?

884
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,000
MAZEL TOV.

885
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,500
COUPLE HOURS SURGERY,

886
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,000
YOU'LL BE READY
TO PUSH OUT THOSE 14 CHILDREN.

887
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,300
YOU DO IT BOTH WAYS,
RIGHT?

888
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,300
WHAT?

889
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,700
THE ULTRASOUND-YOU DO IT
STANDING UP AND LYING DOWN.

890
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,000
WHAT ELSE WOULD I MEAN?

891
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,500
I'VE DECIDED
YOU COULD DO WORSE

892
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,500
THAN A FEMALE PROXY
FOR ME.

893
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,500
SO YOU'RE GOING TO ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT PEOPLE CAN CHANGE?

894
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:08,300
NO.

895
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,000
YOU THINK I'VE CHANGED
OR AMBER'S CHANGED?

896
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:10,800
NOPE.

897
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,800
THEN YOU'VE CHANGED.

898
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,500
IF YOU DO CHANGE,
CAN IT BE THE PART OF YOU

899
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,900
THAT CHASES ME DOWN HALLS,
TRYING TO CHANGE ME?

900
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,100
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THIS MEANS?

901
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,500
THAT YOU MADE
ONE GO DATING CHOICE.

902
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:24,600
THE FABRIC OF THE SPACE/TIME
CONTINUUM COULD UNRAVEL.

903
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,800
MY WORLD COULD EXPAND.

904
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,900
I COULD FORM
A LONG-TERM CONNECTION

905
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,100
THAT ISN'T WITH YOU.

906
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,000
AND SINCE YOU PUT

907
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,500
THE DARKEST POSSIBLE
CONSTRUCTION ON EVERYTHING,

908
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,800
YOU COULD END UP
LOSING A FRIEND.

909
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,100
YOU'VE THOUGHT
OF ALL THIS.

910
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:43,700
<i>AND YET...</i>

911
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,000
YOU'RE GOING ALONG WITH IT.

912
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,700
ARE YOU BEING...
SELF-SACRIFICING?

913
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:55,200
I'LL SACRIFICE A LAB RAT,

914
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,600
I'LL SACRIFICE A FLY,

915
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,800
AND I'LL SACRIFICE $200
ON A MUDDER AT MONMOUTH PARK.

916
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,400
I DON'T SACRIFICE SELF.
