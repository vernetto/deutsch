1
00:00:03,069 --> 00:00:05,594
Dr. Lee, call 4142.

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:08,266
Dr. Lee, 4142.

3
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,284
Will it, uh, be much longer?

4
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:21,286
We'll call you when we're ready.

5
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,288
I've been waiting
almost an hour.

6
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,790
We'll call you when we're ready.

7
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,793
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,974
Saw him make quite a throw yesterday.

9
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,738
There's a liner to left field
coming to third base's right.

10
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:48,247
Laskowski is up.
The throw on the way to the plate.

11
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:50,578
So she's really coming back?

12
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,584
Who's coming back?

13
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:54,620
You don't know her.

14
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:58,919
You give her a raise?
Increase her benefits?

15
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:02,428
Don't have TiVo on this thing.
Can't rewind. Shut up.

16
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:07,724
You lower her hours?
You don't even know her.

17
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:11,100
Who is this guy?
He's a patient.

18
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:15,164
He's examining me.
He's gotta go back to work as soon
as I'm done with the examination.

19
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:18,610
Guess I do too.

20
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:22,273
It's gotta be something.
I mean, she didn't come back
because she likes you.

21
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:24,282
Mmm.

22
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:28,480
Wait a minute.

23
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:30,921
She did come back
because she likes you.

24
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,517
You dog. You slept with her.

25
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,859
Keep talking.
I'll finish your exam
with a prostate check.

26
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:41,500
I've agreed to take her
on one date.

27
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:44,469
- What?
- So, you into this girl?

28
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:47,938
- Yes.
- No. She-- She's not giving me any choice.

29
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:51,670
Wait. She's making you do her?

30
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:53,678
Date her.

31
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:58,012
Young ingenue doctor falling in love
with gruff, older mentor--

32
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:01,781
Her sweet, gentle nature
bringing him to a closer,

33
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:04,346
fuller understanding
of his wounded heart.

34
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,085
Do her...

35
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,490
or you're gay.

36
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:12,224
For God's sakes.

37
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:16,462
# Sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G #
Grow up. And learn to harmonize.

38
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:19,971
- Oh!
- Damn it!

39
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:24,032
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Who the hell walks around
with an open urine sample?

40
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,136
I'm sorry. I didn't-- I didn't--

41
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:30,149
Uh--

42
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:35,787
You think that was a bit
of an overreaction?

43
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:39,382
Well, he peed on me.
I'm not into that.

44
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:41,393
It's apple juice.

45
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:43,395
Now go find that guy
and apologize.

46
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:47,092
One more patient complaint
and you're looking at a suspension.

47
00:02:57,644 --> 00:03:00,943
I forgive you for ruining my jacket.

48
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:05,847
Look, you seem like
a regular kind of guy--

49
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,944
not the type to get
another regular guy into trouble.

50
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,955
Am I right?

51
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:17,221
Twenty bucks cash if you'll stop crying.

52
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:20,926
Forgive me. Yell at me.
Just give me something I can work with, okay?

53
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,815
Game's over.

54
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,215
You two make nice?
Get a wheelchair.

55
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:41,753
Get this guy into the E.R.
What happened?

56
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:44,415
- Right pupil's blown.
- Holy--

57
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,050
You gave the guy a stroke?

58
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:24,755
So the bear wipes himself
with the rabbit.

59
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:28,190
Lame.

60
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,601
Hey.
Yo.

61
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:33,935
What are you doing here?
I work here.

62
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:36,441
"Here" here? In this office?

63
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:38,704
House practically begged me
to come back.

64
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,269
- Please tell me you took him to the cleaners.
- Same lousy salary.

65
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:46,375
- Then why'd you do it?
- Because this is the happiest place on Earth.

66
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,785
Twenty-one-year-old male--
Comes in with grinding of the teeth.

67
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:53,622
And House gives him a stroke.
Totally blew out his pupil.

68
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:57,151
- You scared a guy into stroking out?
- Does that surprise anyone here?

69
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,631
Blown pupils usually means
brain stem edema.
Sure,

70
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,192
but since he's not dead or in a coma,
I'm going with stroke to the optic nerve.

71
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,467
C.T. scan shows two things.

72
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,735
Ischemia-- death of brain tissue.

73
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,004
Means there's been some damage,
hopefully not permanent.

74
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:17,380
- And?
- And that's it. There's nothing there
to tell us what the underlying cause is.

75
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:21,181
- Gotta do an M.R.I.
- You're looking at the wrong part
of the scan.

76
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:24,655
- I'm looking at the brain.
What else is there?
- The jaw.

77
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:27,215
The jaw tells us why he stroked?

78
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:30,262
No, the jaw tells us
why we can't do an M.R.I.

79
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,924
Unless we want his jawbone
flying across the room.

80
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:36,799
Metal plate. He's had major reconstruction,
and there's no way we're removing it,

81
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:38,837
so we're forced to be clever.

82
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,203
Angiogram to rule out vasculitis,

83
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:45,210
E.M.G. for peripheral neuropathy,
tox screen to eliminate drugs,

84
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:48,111
and echo to rule out cardiac emboli.

85
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:55,877
Dr. Cameron, I'd appreciate you keeping
the terms of your new contract to yourself.

86
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:59,049
Don't want everyone
clamoring for the same perks.

87
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:06,063
What perks?
Nothing you'd be interested in.

88
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:08,896
So it's not money, then?
Office space, insurance, parking--

89
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:11,402
Anything he could offer you,
we'd be interested in.

90
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:14,565
He agreed to go
on a date with me.

91
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,576
A date? Date, dinner and a movie,
naked and sweaty, date?

92
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:21,238
He only committed to the first two.

93
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,612
He's so-- He's so old.

94
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:27,449
- And you're so young.
- It's a big mistake.

95
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,080
It's my boss.
I'm allowed to sexually harass my boss.

96
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:33,250
I'll arrange for the E.M.G.
You want to set up the angiogram?

97
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:36,386
And you can get the blood samples,
patient history, patient consent.

98
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,734
Like watching an accident
about to happen.

99
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:51,976
Morning.

100
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:56,012
Harvey, I'm Dr. Foreman.
I'm here to discuss your case.

101
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,518
I'm Annette.
I'm Harvey's friend.

102
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,520
Nice to meet you.

103
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:07,252
I need your next of kin.
You didn't fill that out on your intake form.

104
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:09,123
Harvey's parents are dead.

105
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,959
They died two years ago
in a car crash.

106
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:15,930
I see.
So, Harvey, you have any siblings?

107
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:18,698
No. And no grandparents,

108
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,968
or uncles or aunts.

109
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:25,033
Annette, uh, I don't want to have
to ask you to leave--

110
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,579
I want her to stay.

111
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:30,673
Well, she can stay.
You do the talking.

112
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,486
Why'd you come to the clinic this morning?

113
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,894
Uh, about six months ago,
I started grinding my--

114
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:51,298
You know. In your mouth.
You chew with them.

115
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,203
Teeth.

116
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:58,368
Harvey's experiencing
a little nominal aphasia.
Hmm.

117
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:00,378
You know, when you can't
remember nouns.

118
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:02,471
Yeah, I think I know
what nominal aphasia is.

119
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:04,539
Have you had any treatment
for the teeth grinding?

120
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:07,017
I went to a--

121
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:11,648
You know, they do that thing
with the sharp pointy things.

122
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:14,090
- Needles? Someone took your blood?
- No. They make you breathe.

123
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,095
- Pulmonologist?
- No. She had this, uh--

124
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,927
She had this electrical machine.

125
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,933
He saw an acupuncturist.

126
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,265
Mm-hmm.

127
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:29,874
Do you know
what the acupuncturist did?

128
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:32,570
She diagnosed liver chi stagnation
and sent Harvey to a shen balancer.

129
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:37,105
He referred him
to a homeopathic doctor,
who sent him to a chiropractor.

130
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:41,916
Naturally.
The chiropractor thought it might be food
sensitivity and sent Harvey to a naturopath.

131
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:44,718
The naturopath sent me
back to the--

132
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,725
- Back to the acupuncturist.
- Yes.

133
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:51,024
Okay. Well, we'll need to see
the records...

134
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:54,032
of all of those, uh, practitioners.

135
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,034
Okay.
Thank you.

136
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:03,075
Everything set for the angiogram?

137
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:06,475
Cameron's got the E.M.G. first.
Who's that?

138
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,810
Harvey's guru.

139
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:13,284
- That's what she called herself?
- That's what she acted like.

140
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:29,662
Hi. I'm having vaginal pain.

141
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,239
Pleasure to meet you.

142
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:38,937
My OB/GYN died recently.
He was a nice man.

143
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:43,243
- Warm hands.
- Not anymore.

144
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:45,910
So, does it hurt when you tinkle?

145
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:49,785
Yeah, that's when it's worst.

146
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:53,792
You have some vaginal tearing.

147
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:55,793
No sign of bruising.

148
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:58,193
No indication of trauma,
forced entry.

149
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:02,758
Ramona, you naughty girl.

150
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:05,770
Either you've got yourself
an 18-year-old boyfriend,

151
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:08,432
or an 80-year-old
with some little blue pills.

152
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:10,702
Myron thought he'd just try 'em out.

153
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:14,439
- Lucky you.
- I guess.

154
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:16,447
You'd prefer it if Myron was a little...

155
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:19,211
droopier?
Maybe a little.

156
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:23,449
We used to hold hands
or read together...

157
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:25,615
or watch Jeopardy.

158
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:29,991
I haven't seen Jeopardy
in almost a month.

159
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,298
Have you talked to him about this?

160
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:36,392
You try talking a 73-year-old
out of sex.

161
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:40,667
With all these male enhancements,
the pressure to put out's incredible.

162
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,868
It's worse than high school.

163
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:47,709
He doesn't get what he wants from me,
he'll get it from Connie
in the corner condo.

164
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:52,649
She's dying her hair red.
Major league slut.

165
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:57,818
Here's a prescription...

166
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:00,256
for vaginal estrogen suppositories.

167
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,851
It'll help with the lubrication.

168
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:04,862
Thank you.

169
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,489
Maybe you could give Myron
a prescription--

170
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:10,728
something weaker
than he's got now.

171
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:14,569
Tell him it's better for his heart.
He'd buy that.

172
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,575
You can't tell him the truth
so you want me to lie to him?

173
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:21,579
- Would you?
- Close your legs.

174
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,947
Nerves stimulate muscles to move
by creating a small electrical current.

175
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,684
The machine will measure that.

176
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:38,287
And I will insert this needle
into various muscles and ask you to flex.

177
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:42,892
Sometimes it can be painful.
Let me know. I can pull back.

178
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:44,765
No.

179
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:47,135
I mean, it's okay.

180
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,540
Okay. Put your arm out to the side.

181
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:02,412
- You all right?
- I'm good.

182
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,479
You don't have to stop.

183
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,593
Raise your arm over your head.

184
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:22,607
The E.M.G. was clean.

185
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:26,668
Based on this history,
it's either toxic herbs from the homeopath,

186
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,340
spinal damage
from the chiropractor,

187
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:33,010
infection from a needle
that the acupuncturist
accidentally let sit in eye of newt,

188
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,315
or the shen balancer--

189
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:38,686
What the hell is a shen,
and how come it's lopsided?

190
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,488
The only abnormal test result
we found was on the echo report.

191
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,721
Mitral valve prolapse.

192
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:47,732
Hang up a shingle and condemn
the narrowness and greed
of Western medicine.

193
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,791
You can make a damn fine living.

194
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:53,669
Clots form on the faulty valve,
get sent to the brain,
voilà-- stroke.

195
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:56,469
Ofcourse, no harm, no foul.

196
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,942
Just taking a few bucks
from superstitious idiots, right?

197
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:02,845
Could also be an aneurysm
due to trauma.

198
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:06,476
Trauma?
From what, the chiropractic treatments?

199
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:10,386
It's bacterial endocarditis,
an infected valve.
We should do blood cultures.

200
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,651
The six months that he had
with these charlatans...

201
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:16,252
might have been better spent
going to someone who looks at things
that exist in the real world.

202
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:18,796
But that's just me
being all narrow again.

203
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:21,765
I noticed a small bruit
when I listened to Harvey's
left carotid.

204
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:23,927
You could hear that
if he had an aneurysm from trauma.

205
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:25,994
An aneurysm would have shown
on the angiogram.

206
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:28,631
No. Not necessarily.

207
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,576
Hmm.

208
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,669
Quite a dilemma.

209
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:38,706
Oh, great pool-hall oracle,
grant me guidance.

210
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:43,346
Do we go with Foreman's theory,
which is at least marginally supported
by medical test results,

211
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:46,983
or Chase's theory,
that is completely unsupported
by medical evidence?

212
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:49,050
What to do?

213
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:51,062
The guy obviously broke his jaw
somehow.

214
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,099
Who knows what other trauma he's suffered?
We should do the angiogram again.

215
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:57,294
And all signs point to--

216
00:13:57,369 --> 00:14:01,396
Ah. Sorry, Chase.
The gods have spoken.

217
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:05,000
Start Harvey on blood thinners
and antibiotics.

218
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:08,240
Wow. Yeah, I get it.
House is adorable.

219
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:11,249
I just want to hold him
and never let go.

220
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:19,687
My God! What the hell are you doing?

221
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:22,852
- She's choking him.
- Foreman, stop. Let her go.

222
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:25,192
- She was trying to kill him.
- No. No, she wasn't.

223
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:28,563
His vitals seem okay.
Please-- Please, don't hurt her.

224
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:32,533
What the hell is going on in here?

225
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:38,242
She's-- She's a dominatrix.

226
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,278
Right, Annette?

227
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,387
The patient asked you to strangle him?

228
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,552
Harvey is an asphyxiaphyliac.

229
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:58,324
He likes to be strangled or smothered.

230
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:02,163
That's just sick.
Well, that's an intriguing
legal opinion.

231
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,759
Geez. What kind of a lawyer is he?

232
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:07,101
- You want a legal opinion?
Call the cops.
- I was careful.

233
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:12,075
I watched the monitors.
Made sure his O2 sats were over 90.
I would never hurt him.

234
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:14,977
Then what was the point?
Harvey was upset.

235
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:16,981
He needed to calm down--

236
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:19,176
to feel in control
by being controlled.

237
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:26,157
He pays you for this?

238
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:29,023
In return, he does my taxes
and cleans my house.

239
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:34,992
We're not done here.
We have to talk.
Call the cops.

240
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:37,695
Bar her from the hospital.
Force her to pierce your nipples.

241
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,704
Not really medical decisions.

242
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,475
It was a long time ago.

243
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:47,034
I was seeing this woman, a banker,

244
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:50,377
and, uh, turns out
she liked to be burned.

245
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:54,180
You actually dated someone
who likes to get burned?

246
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:56,312
Yeah, why would you want
to be in a relationship...

247
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:58,982
with someone that's so obviously
only gonna lead to pain?

248
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:01,754
- Shut up.
- It was a weird scene.

249
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:06,457
- I observed--
- Chase, did you know about this woman,
what she does?

250
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:10,696
- I met her at some parties, yeah.
- I wouldn't have tortured you
if I knew you liked it.

251
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:13,033
Well, here's a phrase to remember.

252
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:16,802
"Hey, this guy might have been
pounded on the head
one too many times".

253
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:20,072
I said I thought it was
a trauma-induced aneurysm.
Yeah. Could have carried...

254
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,807
a tad more weight
if you'd mentioned the "liking pain" thing.

255
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:24,974
You're on my naughty list.

256
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,541
Sorry. No leather stethoscope
this Christmas.

257
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:30,918
- I'm not into--
- I assume you never started him
on antibiotics and blood thinners...

258
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,424
before Mistress Ilsa's rude interruption.

259
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:37,189
- That was probably a good thing, given--
- Start him on antibiotics
and blood thinners.

260
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:39,253
You still think Chase is wrong?

261
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,356
No, he's probably right.

262
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,364
Then we should schedule him
for vascular surgery.

263
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:47,667
Go into the carotids,
find the aneurysm, repair it.

264
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,731
We put him on blood thinners,
he might bleed out.

265
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:53,005
But if Foreman's right about
it being bacterial endocarditis and we--

266
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,247
I think Chase is right.

267
00:16:57,316 --> 00:17:00,080
Okay. If Foreman used to be right
about it being blood clots...

268
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:04,020
and we take the surgery route,
we'll probably kill the guy.

269
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:07,752
So start him on blood thinners,
and if he has another stroke,
we'll schedule the surgery.

270
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:09,851
- Yeah?
- You Dr. House?

271
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:13,227
I have a feeling I'm gonna
regret this, but yes.

272
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:17,735
Ramona said I should come to you
for my refill.

273
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:20,067
Uh, you know, the--

274
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:22,073
The wood's beginning to droop.

275
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:28,538
She said you'd probably
want to talk to me first.

276
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,878
She lied.

277
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:33,281
Here you go.

278
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:35,217
Thanks.

279
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:38,984
Always happy to make people happy.
Good-bye.

280
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:44,255
Uh, I don't know how much more
of this I can take.

281
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:46,559
- Much more of what?
- Sex.

282
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:49,123
You don't want more sex?

283
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,135
My golf swing is all messed up.

284
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:55,105
Hey, here's a radical thought.
Talk to her.

285
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:58,575
- The truth?
- Sounds crazy when you put it like that.

286
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:00,612
Ramona's got a big appetite.

287
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,443
If I don't perform--

288
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:05,449
I don't want to lose her.

289
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:10,821
You got a pharmacy around here?

290
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:13,756
In the hospital?
Could be.

291
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:16,454
Let's see if we can find it.

292
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:26,771
Got any blue pills?

293
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,831
You looking for E.D. medication?

294
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:33,275
Well, that's one example
of a blue pill.
Name six others.

295
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:35,506
There's a brand of acetaminophen--

296
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:39,017
Perfect. Fill 'er up.

297
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:45,113
- Dr. House.
- Little busy here.

298
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:49,217
I heard about Dr. Cameron's conditions
for coming back to work.

299
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:52,695
It's purely business.
I'll make sure you get the receipt.

300
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:55,358
Well, I think it's a good thing.

301
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:57,527
What happened
in your last relationship,

302
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:59,867
it's no reason to wall yourself off
from people forever.

303
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:03,066
Five years of self-pity is probably enough.

304
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,703
Wow. You've certainly given me
a lot to think about.

305
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:09,042
If only I was as open as you.

306
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:12,208
- Well--
- Actually, it was your blouse
I was talking about.

307
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,250
Bear in mind, Cameron's probably
the only female who could tolerate you.

308
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,519
Wear the sky-blue shirt.

309
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:24,084
It almost makes you look nice.

310
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:29,226
They said she couldn't come back
into the hospital.

311
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:32,236
They won't let me see her.

312
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:35,398
Harvey, you're lucky
she wasn't arrested.

313
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:38,568
What were you thinking,
doing that at a hospital?

314
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:41,238
Squeeze my fingers?

315
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:44,908
I was scared.
I'll need you to squeeze
with both hands.

316
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:47,918
I am.

317
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:50,511
Weakness in his right arm
and hand.

318
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:53,752
Harvey's having mini-strokes.
The blood thinners aren't making
a difference.

319
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:55,759
Stop the treatment.

320
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:58,421
Sorry. We tried your way.
You could not have been "wronger".

321
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:00,761
I said Chase was probably right.
Oh, yeah.

322
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:02,925
We've all got perfect
20/20 hindsight.

323
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:04,935
Get ahold of May in Vascular.

324
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:08,097
See if his surgical dance card
is free for tomorrow.

325
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,708
- About tomorrow night.
- You couldn't keep your mouth shut.

326
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:16,111
I didn't see any reason to.

327
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:18,775
Where are we going?
I want to make sure I dress appropriately.

328
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,785
That would be army boots
and T-shirt.

329
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:24,947
It's the county paint ball tourney.
First prize is 50 bucks.

330
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:26,957
I'll split it with you
if you hold your end up.

331
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:28,959
I'm not sure that was the deal.

332
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:32,292
Relax. I made a reservation
at Café Spoleto.

333
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:34,298
Regarding wardrobe,

334
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:36,391
are you too young to remember spandex?

335
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:39,562
I'll figure something out.

336
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:46,236
The surgery will repair the damaged
blood vessels in your neck,

337
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:48,245
and your strokes will stop.

338
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:50,577
All this is because of the strangulation?

339
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:54,085
More like strangulations.

340
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:59,757
My parents are right.

341
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:02,293
I'm a loser.

342
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:04,352
I don't -- I don't know what--

343
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:07,330
- I don't know what to do.
I need to--
- Harvey, calm down.

344
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:09,833
- I need to talk to Annette.
- You can do this on your own.

345
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:12,665
Surgery's the only--
She hates me.

346
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:15,263
I've been calling.
I've been calling and she--

347
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,832
She's not picking up.

348
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:23,438
- Harvey, you don't need--
- I can't. I can't.

349
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:38,186
Harvey, you will do what I say.

350
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:40,231
I don't want surgery.

351
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:45,236
- Sign the consent. Sign it!
- I can't do anything.

352
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,705
No surgery. No surgery!

353
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:52,201
No surgery!

354
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:56,973
We could give him antidepressants.
See if he changes his mind.

355
00:21:57,049 --> 00:22:00,075
I already did.
Mashed 'em up in his apple sauce.

356
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:03,747
It'll lighten him up soon enough.
Someone should just
tell him to do it.

357
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,757
Way faster.
So's forgery-- also illegal.

358
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:10,261
And I already tried.
Not you.

359
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:13,594
Where's a good dominatrix
when you need one?

360
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,599
Annette's barred from the hospital.

361
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,601
If you get caught,
Cuddy's got a hairbrush,

362
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,864
and believe me,
she knows how to use it.

363
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:29,847
They let you come back.

364
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,542
Not because you deserve it.

365
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:36,746
You've been bad.

366
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:39,848
You will have the surgery.
Do you understand?

367
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:43,861
No.

368
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:45,897
Do not laugh at me.

369
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:48,933
- You will respect me.
- Where do you get off
telling me what to do?

370
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,764
Get out of my room,
you bag-faced witch.

371
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:53,896
Is this a part of their deal?

372
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:56,236
This isn't like him.

373
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:00,702
- Something's wrong.
- Get out!

374
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:04,078
Get out! Get out! Get out!

375
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:07,448
- Get out!
- Emotional swings--
he's having another stroke.

376
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:10,317
Harvey!

377
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:14,155
He's crashing.
Can we get a cart in here?

378
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:23,432
So what's that?
Two strokes you've scared this guy into?

379
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:27,939
Yeah. It's making me question
my view of myself
as a people person.

380
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:31,271
Now you want to do surgery on him
without his consent?

381
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:33,311
The kid's in a coma.
He needs the surgery.

382
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:35,778
He said no.
We can't do it.

383
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:39,112
Emergent situation.
We invoke heroic measures.

384
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:41,846
You need a court order.
Great. Where do I
get me one of them?

385
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,856
- Do I need to lawyer up?
- I'll need to show the judge
an affidavit from next of kin.

386
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:49,416
They might have a problem
signing anything,
seeing as how they're dead.

387
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:53,658
- He'll want proof.
- Like what, Dad's hand?
I don't even know where they're buried.

388
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:58,499
Bring me a published obit,
or death certificate,
and we'll run with it.

389
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,470
I don't want you to mess up your clothes.

390
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:05,476
His parents were accountants.

391
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:07,910
Maybe there's an obit
in the trade papers.
Guy lives in Market Town.

392
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:10,607
I don't know if he grew up there,
but we could check
the local funeral homes.

393
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:12,673
Great, and when your searches
turn up nothing,

394
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:15,584
you should try and find
where they live.
He said they were dead.

395
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:18,088
Accountants are usually
pretty good with money,

396
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:20,590
so how come he lives
in a slum like Market Town?

397
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:23,594
Maybe they were bad accountants.

398
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:25,596
Two bad accountants
from the Pacific Rim?

399
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:28,132
The odds are astronomical.
Maybe Harvey burned
through their money.

400
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,294
Or maybe they cut him off
when they found out
about his proclivities.

401
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:35,100
Gotta be my bet.
Go to his apartment.
See if you can find his folks.

402
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:38,040
Number, address, something.

403
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:46,016
Hey. Can I talk to you?

404
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:48,986
Sure.

405
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:53,383
Look. Cameron's a friend.

406
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:57,087
- This whole dating--
- Time's up. Thanks for playing.

407
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:00,563
Hey, I've been on the scene
more than you recently.
Way ahead of you.

408
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:03,897
I got a case of malt liquor
stashed in the trunk.

409
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:06,233
Mr. Marvin Gaye on the CD.

410
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,932
We are gonna get all the way down.
Now move.

411
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:12,743
Come on. You're not into her.

412
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:16,747
Most guys who aren't interested in
a woman try to sugar coat it,
be nice.

413
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:19,909
- Oh, you know me too well.
- That's what I'm saying.

414
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:23,921
I think you should go
with your instincts here.
Be a jerk.

415
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:26,082
I'm missing my soap for this?

416
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:28,352
Women love to be right.

417
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:32,089
You gotta leave 'em feeling superior,
like they dodged a bullet.

418
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:35,724
But if you're nice,
she'll blame herself--

419
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,132
And fall for me even more.

420
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:41,969
The love doctor has made an art
out of breaking up with women...

421
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:46,272
'cause you're convinced that the loss of you
would be too devastating
for any woman to handle.

422
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:51,213
Yeah. I'm the one
with the serious ego problem here.

423
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:53,581
I'm just saying...

424
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:56,485
some relationships
aren't meant to happen.

425
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,434
Harvey's school registration.

426
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:14,563
Permanent home address?
Emergency contacts?

427
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:16,573
"Annette Rains".

428
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:19,906
Mistress Annette.

429
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,314
You had to extort a date out of House.

430
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:28,113
You don't think that's a bad sign?

431
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:30,120
Cameron?

432
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:32,748
High school yearbook.

433
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:36,624
Think this might give us
a clue, Sherlock?

434
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:41,698
House isn't gonna hand you anything.

435
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,961
You want him,
you gotta take him.

436
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:45,969
Jump him.

437
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:48,870
Harvey-- H-A-R-V-E-Y.

438
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,874
I'm sorry to have bothered you.
Thank you. Okay.

439
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:54,639
Yes. Harvey Park.

440
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:56,840
Great. We've been looking for you.

441
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:59,782
I'm calling from the Princeton
Plainsboro Teaching Hospital.

442
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:01,944
Harvey's here, and it's rather--

443
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:05,823
- He hung up.
- You tell him why you were calling?

444
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,619
I didn't get a chance.
Call back.

445
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:10,217
I'll do it.

446
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:13,529
Let the master show you
how it's done.

447
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:20,738
Mr. Park?
This is Dr. House calling...

448
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,864
from Princeton Plainsboro
Teaching Hospital
in New Jersey.

449
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:26,809
Your son Harvey is dead.
We need you to identify the body.

450
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:30,072
Yes. I'm sorry. It's the law.

451
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,384
Okay.

452
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:37,751
There's a real art to delivering
bad news.

453
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:43,089
- They're gonna show up at the morgue.
- Be sure and let me know
when Cuddy starts screaming.

454
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:51,033
You lied to them!
He told us our son was dead.

455
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:53,730
It's only a white lie.

456
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:56,831
Technically, all I did was
call them a little early.

457
00:27:56,908 --> 00:27:59,103
Trust me.
He'll be dead real soon.

458
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:02,510
Actually, I saved you
some rush hour traffic.

459
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,673
I'm calling our lawyer.

460
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:08,685
Fine. Just as soon as you've signed
the surgery consent.

461
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:12,051
I have a pen.

462
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,454
Marilyn Park for Mark Lerner.
Yes, I'll hold.

463
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:25,094
Harvey's your son.
I'm sure you still care about him.

464
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:28,606
He humiliated us.

465
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:32,268
Everybody we know knows about his...
perversion.

466
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:36,040
But you don't get off on embarrassment
the way your son does.

467
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:38,082
My guess, maybe it skips a generation.

468
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:40,447
How much money would it take
to compensate you--

469
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:43,646
Yeah, you guys can haggle in a minute,
but here's the thing.

470
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:47,749
Humiliation comes in all kinds
of packages.

471
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:49,760
People finding out
that your son's a perv.

472
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:53,264
That's pretty high up there.

473
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:57,199
People finding out that you'd
rather let your son die...

474
00:28:57,268 --> 00:28:59,702
than sign a piece of paper--

475
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:01,762
where's that rank?

476
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,900
Trust me,
if I have to paste up a sign...

477
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:08,639
in every nail salon
and dumpling shop in Pennsylvania,
I'll make sure they know.

478
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:28,790
Your son will be in surgery
first thing in the morning.

479
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:35,101
Dumplings.
That was a cheap shot.

480
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:44,577
Hi. Are you, uh--

481
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:46,583
Can we talk?

482
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:50,485
Gee, I wonder what this
is gonna be about.

483
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:54,417
I just want to make sure
no one gets hurt.

484
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:57,757
I will be fine.
Everybody's acting like I'm going out
with Jack the Ripper.

485
00:29:57,829 --> 00:30:01,788
Oh. It's not--
It's not you I'm worried about.

486
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:09,329
It's been a long time
since he opened up to someone,
and I--

487
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:12,535
You better be absolutely sure
you want this,

488
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:16,512
because if he opens up again
and gets hurt--

489
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:19,716
I don't think there's gonna be
a next time.

490
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:23,313
You're worried
I'm gonna break his heart?

491
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:37,797
The wide side's too short.

492
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:40,235
You're gonna look like Lou Costello.

493
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:45,401
This is a mistake.

494
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:48,934
I don't know how to have
casual conversation.

495
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:51,846
You think you're talking
about one thing,

496
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:53,907
and either you are,
and it's incredibly boring,

497
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:58,115
or you're not because there's a subtext,
and you need a decoder ring.

498
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,783
Open doors for her.
Help her with her chair.

499
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:05,125
- I have been on a date.
- Not since disco died.

500
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,596
Comment on her shoes,
her earrings,

501
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:10,691
and then move on
to D.H.A.

502
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:14,363
Her dreams, hopes and aspirations.

503
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:17,237
Trust me. Panty peeler.

504
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:22,271
- And if you need condoms, I've got some.
- Did your wife give them to you?

505
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:26,750
Drug rep.
They've got antibiotics built in somehow.

506
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:29,286
I should cancel.

507
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:31,788
I've got a patient in surgery
tomorrow morning.

508
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:34,791
And if you were a surgeon,
that would actually matter.

509
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:40,497
That's a good idea.
Settle your nerves.
Get me a beer too.

510
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,499
No beer.

511
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:46,059
You're gonna eat before dinner?

512
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:56,306
This is pretty lame, right?

513
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:02,411
I think she likes lame.

514
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,747
It's beautiful.

515
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:08,758
And you look very handsome.

516
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:12,262
Thank you.

517
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:15,493
I've always loved this restaurant.

518
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:20,003
Yeah. It's changed a lot
since the last time I was here.

519
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:22,005
Used to be a strip joint.

520
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:28,669
Nice earrings.

521
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:31,476
My mom's. Thank you.

522
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,977
Nice shoes.

523
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:38,284
Comfortable?

524
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:41,018
I'm not expecting you to be
someone you're not.

525
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,694
We're in a restaurant.

526
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:47,026
We're dressed up.
We're eating.

527
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:49,999
Without small talk, what is there?

528
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,247
According to Freud--
and I'm paraphrasing--

529
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:11,982
the instinct of love toward an object
demands a mastery to obtain it,

530
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:15,753
and if a person feels
they can't control the object,
or feel threatened by it,

531
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,091
they act negatively toward it.

532
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:21,188
Like an eighth-grade boy
punching a girl.

533
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:25,326
I treat you like garbage,
so I must really like you.

534
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:32,700
Given your Freudian theory,
what does it mean
if I start being nice to you?

535
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:35,610
That you're getting in touch
with your feelings.

536
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,773
Mm-hmm.

537
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:41,546
So there's absolutely nothing I can do
to make you think that I don't like you?

538
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:44,213
Sorry, no.

539
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:52,596
I have one evening with you--
one chance--

540
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:56,099
and I don't want to waste it
talking about what wines
you like...

541
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:58,101
or what movies you hate.

542
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:06,641
I want to know how you feel.

543
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,975
About me.

544
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:20,086
You live under the delusion
that you can fix everything
that isn't perfect.

545
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:24,390
That's why you married a man
who was dying of cancer.

546
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:28,923
You don't love, you need.

547
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,434
And now that your husband is dead,

548
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:34,403
you're looking for your new
charity case.

549
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:37,737
That's why you're
going out with me.

550
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:39,743
I'm twice your age.

551
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:42,041
I'm not great-looking.

552
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:44,741
I'm not charming.
I'm not even nice.

553
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:50,951
What I am is what you need.

554
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,990
I'm damaged.

555
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:12,399
Warm saline.

556
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:14,741
3.0 silk--

557
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:16,803
I'll get the--

558
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:23,412
Came in late.
Good time last night?

559
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:26,514
How's the surgery going?
Harvey's doing fine so far.

560
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:29,685
- How'd the night go?
- It was fine. How was your evening?

561
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:35,093
She had the ravioli.
I had the puttanesca.

562
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:37,634
Yes, I really want to know
about the quality of the food.

563
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:41,695
Either something very good happened
or something very bad.
Which is it?

564
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:44,468
Well, I did have a little
indigestion afterwards.

565
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:46,510
Maybe it was the garlic bread.

566
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:49,375
Or the wine.
Something made my eyes puffy.

567
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:52,644
- Crying in your pillow can do that.
- It was the wine.

568
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:55,652
We had a nice candid conversation.

569
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:00,214
Nothing deep.
Mostly small talk.
I'm sure.

570
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:03,886
Took your advice.
Complimented her shoes.
That's 15 minutes of chat right there.

571
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:08,330
- No snide comments?
- I guess-- when we talked about you guys.

572
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:14,566
- Just answer one question.
- You two gonna do dinner again?

573
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:18,007
I... don't think so.

574
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:20,771
I... don't know.

575
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:24,008
Hey, kids.
You were wrong.

576
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:26,515
No aneurysm, no nothin'.
This guy's clean.

577
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:31,077
Which means we've got no idea
what's causing the strokes.

578
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:33,089
He's had two more post-op.

579
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:35,091
We won't know the extent
of the damage...

580
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:37,252
until he comes out of the coma--
if he comes out.

581
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:40,195
Maybe we should go back
to the blood thinners.
Up the dosage.

582
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:44,701
If it's not clots, a loading dose
of blood thinners is gonna make him
bleed out of his ears.

583
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:46,703
Then he won't be able to hear.

584
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:49,899
Oy vey.

585
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:53,808
- Nobody home. Leave a message.
- This is important.

586
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:59,378
Chase, Cameron, get another
angiogram and echo.

587
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,384
You better get a full body scan.

588
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:04,353
If it is clots, it'd be good
to know where they are.

589
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,660
Sorry about that.

590
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:13,288
Guy dying.

591
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:16,128
Those pills you gave Myron?
They're not working.

592
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,226
Well, good to see you've got
the correct perspective on the thing.

593
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:21,897
Well, the old ones, I mean,
made me feel like a tree, you know?

594
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:23,907
Nice visual.

595
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:26,569
But the new ones,
I might as well be eating candy.

596
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:28,737
Candy wouldn't take away
your headaches.
What?

597
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:31,782
You came to me and told me
you were having too much sex.

598
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:34,647
I never did.
You too, sequoia.

599
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:37,449
- Well, no, that's not true. I--
- I know everybody lies,

600
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:40,820
but you'd think that after
a certain amount of time together,
you wouldn't be trying so hard.

601
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:47,929
- Your rings don't match.
- Why would they?

602
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:52,766
The style is one thing,
but one silver, one gold?
How long have you guys been married?

603
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:56,170
Fifty-five years.
Forty-nine years.

604
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,368
Damn it. You're having an affair.

605
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,968
Did you really say
you wanted to have less sex?

606
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:05,880
Well, less.
If I wanted none,
I'd stay home with Esther.

607
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,815
I just need a little rest.

608
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:11,286
You guys aren't the victims
of the little blue pills,
you're the problem.

609
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:13,550
- I'm sorry.
- Me too.

610
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,649
I should just have told you how I felt.

611
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:18,627
Aw.

612
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:23,666
Oh, welcome to hell.

613
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:36,813
Uh, hey,
how about the pills?

614
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:40,715
Looks like you guys are good to go
drug-free for a while.

615
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:46,019
Dr. Chase, these breath mints
you've been popping since yesterday--

616
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,251
are they a new fetish?

617
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:51,989
I found them at Harvey's.
What? I just took two boxes.

618
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:55,726
- The guy's got a whole drawer of them.
- And you didn't find that interesting?

619
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,030
Well, there's lots of interesting stuff
in his place.

620
00:38:58,102 --> 00:39:00,332
The mints weren't high up
on the list.

621
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:02,429
Wrong.

622
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:18,846
Chase, get your nose in here.

623
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:21,016
If you're trying to humiliate me,

624
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:23,890
I told you--
Come on.
Put your face in his mouth.

625
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,366
- Ugh!
- Rich, wouldn't you say?

626
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:34,563
Mm. Smells like old vomit.

627
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:37,766
Number one sign
of fulminating osteomyelitis.

628
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:40,037
Infection of the jaw?

629
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:43,569
Probably from the original break.
Never healed properly.

630
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:45,740
Infected tissue from the jaw...

631
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:50,378
breaks off,
blocks blood flow to the brain.

632
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:53,150
And life just isn't worth living
without blood.

633
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,658
It was hidden from the scans
by the metal plate.

634
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:59,321
And an infection in the jaw
is unlikely to show up in blood tests.

635
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,957
- So how do we confirm?
- Like this.

636
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:18,470
Ladies and gentlemen, we have pus.

637
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:23,286
We're gonna remove the jaw.

638
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,579
Anybody got a buzz saw?
Okay, call a surgeon.

639
00:40:58,155 --> 00:41:00,089
Hi. I'm Dr. House.

640
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,727
How's tricks, Annette?

641
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:11,200
I just wanted to see if he was okay.

642
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:13,498
I'll leave.

643
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:17,268
It's okay.
I came to talk to you both.

644
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:19,502
Like I tell all my patients,

645
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:22,341
you've simply got to say no
to strangulation.

646
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:26,576
Me, I'm a freak.

647
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,618
I get off on not being in pain.

648
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:31,587
That and chocolate-covered
marshmallow bunnies.

649
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,646
He's not a freak.

650
00:41:33,724 --> 00:41:36,249
Yeah, he is... a little.

651
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:39,194
But it's gotta stop,

652
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:41,493
or he'll die.

653
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:46,068
It's not about pain.

654
00:41:46,136 --> 00:41:48,730
It's about being open.

655
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:53,038
And completely vulnerable
to another person.

656
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:58,407
If you can learn
to be that deeply trusting,

657
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:02,380
it changes you.

658
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:12,591
Lock him in a cage.

659
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:14,893
That should be fine, medically.

660
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:20,269
Dr. House?

661
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:25,608
Were my parents here?

662
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:31,411
Did they come to see me?
