1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,100
We Just Arrived.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:04,600
Yeah.

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,400
The Kids Okay
On Your End?

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,300
Good.

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,800
Yeah, Yeah,
He's Very Excited.

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,600
Hey, Listen,
I Gotta Go, Okay?

7
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,900
I'll Call You Tomorrow.

8
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,100
'Scuse Me.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 <I>Get Away.</I>

10
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,800
Get Away.

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,500
Sorry About That.
Sorry.

12
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,000
What's Wrong With Him?

13
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:29,800
Excuse Us.

14
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,600
I Oughta Go Back And Kick
The Hell Outta That Guy.

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,200
She's Old Enough.

16
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,200
She Didn't Have To Scream
Like That.

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,600
It's Okay, Dad.
It Didn't Bother Me.

18
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,800
For The First Time,
None Of These People Bother Me.

19
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,800
I Just Think--36 More Hours.

20
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,400
36 More Hours.
How Do You Figure That, Kenny?

21
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,600
Tomorrow At This Time,
I'm Scheduled For Surgery.

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,900
It's A Ten-Hour Procedure,
Throw Two In It For Prep.

23
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,900
36 Until I'm Just Another
Face In The Crowd.

24
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,300
Ahem.

25
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,300
Kenny Has A Frontonasal
Encephalocele.

26
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,200
It's A Midline Deformity.

27
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,600
He's Here To Undergo
A Facial Bipartition.

28
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,100
And What Does That Mean?

29
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,700
Well,
We Have Five Surgeons,

30
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,500
 <I>Four Nurses.</I>

31
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,700
 <I>It's Going To Require</I>
 <I>6 Units Of Blood.</I>

32
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,600
 <I>Will It Fix Him?</I>

33
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,600
It'll Repair A Lot
Of The Damage Done By--

34
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,600
We Need A Sound Bite.

35
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,800
Would You Say He'll Be Ready
For The Junior Prom?

36
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,200
Yeah, Yeah.
That's Probably True.

37
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,100
No, I Mean
I Need You To Say It.

38
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,500
 <I>Dr. Chase.</I>

39
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,700
We Got An Issue.

40
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,700
Heart Rate's Sky Rocketing.
He's Over 180.

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,600
He's In V-Fib.
Paddles.

42
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,000
Charge To 300.
Turn That Camera Off.

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,500
Is This A Reaction
To Anesthesia?

44
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,700
<I>Haven't Given It Yet.</I>

45
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:05,900
Clear.

46
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,600
Crank It To 360.

47
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,400
I Said Turn
That Damn Camera Off!

48
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,300
Clear.

52
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,400
A Teenage Boy

53
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,300
With A Cranial
Facial Deformity

54
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,200
Was About To Undergo
A Reconstructive Procedure

55
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,800
When He Had An Unexplained
Cardiac Arrest.

56
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,600
Good.

57
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,200
Good?

58
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,500
 <I>I Mean, Go On.</I>

59
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,200
We Have The Patient
On A Pacing Wire.

60
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,800
It's The Only Thing
Keeping His Heart Going.

61
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,200
Yeah, We Know.
We're Doctors.

62
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,800
Right. It W-Was...
Just For Them.

63
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,900
Just be yourself.

64
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,400
Until We Are Able
To Figure Out

65
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,900
Exactly What Is Causing
The Heart Block,

66
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The Reconstructive Surgery
Is On Hold, Obviously.

67
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,200
That's Yourself?

68
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,000
Fascinating Case.

69
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,400
I Will See You Again
After I Have Saved His Life.

70
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,700
Have A Warm Bath Waiting.

71
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,400
Are You Following Me?

72
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,200
 <I>Darnell Will Be</I>
 <I>Trailing You</I>

73
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,300
Throughout The Case.

74
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,800
<I>Pretend We're Not Here.</I>

75
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,900
If I Do That,
Won't I Bump Into You?

76
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,200
 <I>We'll Stay</I>
 <I>Out Of Your Way.</I>

77
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,000
That's A Joke.

78
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,000
See, I Became A Doctor Because
Of The Movie <I>Patch Adams.</I>

79
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,600
Uh, Listen,
Y-You Wanna Get Ahead Of Me?

80
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,000
Maybe Back Up,
I Don't Know, Low Down,

81
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,500
So I Look More Powerful?

82
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,000
- That's Perfect.
- Yeah?

83
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,800
Also My Eyes Look Better
In Rooms With Summer Colors.

84
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,100
You Know What?
It's Black And White--

85
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,700
You Think I Like
The Cameras?

86
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,300
You Think I Want The Whole World
Watching You Check Out My Ass

87
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,600
And Question My Wardrobe?

88
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,700
Would It Be Better
If I Checked Out Your Wardrobe

89
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,000
And Questioned Your Ass?

90
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,100
A Little Part Of Me--

91
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,700
There Is No Little Part
Of You.

92
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,900
Thought That Maybe
You Would See

93
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,100
What Great P.R. This Could Be
For The Hospital,

94
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,500
And Not Make Me Force You

95
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,000
To Act Like A Human Being.

96
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,900
You Using Force On Me
Is Intriguing.

97
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,900
On The Other Hand,
Cameras Make People Act.

98
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,300
Sometimes Like Human Beings.
Sometimes Just Weird.

99
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,700
Sometimes They Wear
Open-Tip Bras.

100
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,600
It's Cold In Here.

101
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,200
A Less Obvious Point

102
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,200
Is That I Need My Team
To Be Unafraid

103
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,800
Of The Metaphorical Fart.

104
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,700
That Production Company

105
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,700
Is Covering All
The Medical Costs For This Kid.

106
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,400
So Either You Let Them
Continue Filming,

107
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,200
Or The Kid Goes Home
With The Same Face.

108
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,400
Sorry About That.
Private.

109
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,500
She, Um...

110
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,000
Waxes Her Moustache
Once A Month And...

111
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,700
Sometimes Gets Some Pretty
Gnarly Ingrown Hairs.

112
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,200
So Did He Hire You
Flat Out,

113
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,500
Or Are You Competing
For One Of The Spots?

114
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,200
I'm Not Sure
What You Mean By That.

115
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,600
She's Not Competing.

116
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,400
 <I>She Was Hand-Picked</I>
 <I>By House.</I>

117
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,900
She's Safe, Like Foreman.

118
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,300
So That Takes Three Spots
Down To One.

119
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,600
Where's Foreman?

120
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,100
He's In The Bathroom.

121
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,100
Good. Come On.
Let's Go For A Walk.

122
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,000
Walks Look Good On Camera.

123
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,200
They Give The Illusion
Of The Story Moving Forward.

124
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,900
New Patient.

125
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,900
16-Year-Old Boy
With Second Degree

126
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,300
Infranodal Heart Block
Post-Arrest.

127
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,600
Any Reports
Of Lightheadedness Or Syncope?

128
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,900
It's Really Not
Lightheadedness.

129
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,300
Why Did You
Hire Her?

130
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,300
Not In Front Of The Company.

131
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,800
Are We Gonna Be On Tv?

132
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,400
I'm Making A Music Video.
Come On, A Little Faster.

133
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,200
More Energy.

134
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,900
Why Are You Glad
Foreman's Not Here?

135
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,700
Because He Would Object
To What I'm About To Do.

136
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,800
Oh...

137
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,800
danger!
restricted access.

138
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,400
no metal allowed
strong magnetic field

139
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,400
locked.

140
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,000
Hey, Buddy.

141
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,500
You Stay In There.

142
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,500
We'll Be Out Here Making Sure
He Doesn't Move Again.

143
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,400
God! Finally
Hear Myself Think.

144
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,500
Our Patient--

145
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,100
Why Did You Hire Her?

146
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,700
Because She Has
Way More Diagnostic Experience

147
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,100
Than The Other Swimsuit Models
I Was Considering.

148
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,700
Our Patient Has
A Frontonasal Encephalocele

149
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,700
With A Midline Cleft.

150
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,900
Eew.

151
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,900
Don't Stare
Directly At It.

152
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,100
 <I>So What Caused Big Head's</I>
 <I>Heart To Stop?</I>

153
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,900
Simple--His Big Head.

154
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,300
Increased Intracranial Pressure
Would Cause Heart Block.

155
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,800
Wrong, 16 Years
They've Been Testing

156
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,500
That Insane Noggin
To Death.

157
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,800
what about ???

158
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,500
He Has A Midline Anomaly
On His Head.

159
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,300
Makes Sense He'd Have A Midline
Anomaly In His Heart Too.

160
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
That 16 Years Of Testing
Didn't Show?

161
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,500
<I>Why Did You</I>
 <I>Bring Her In So Late?</I>

162
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,600
It's Not Fair.
The Rest Of Us--

163
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,300
Hey, Hey, You Wanted Fair,
You Picked The Wrong Job.

164
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,300
The Wrong Profession.

165
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,200
The Wrong Species.

166
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,100
 <I>Forget The Deformity.</I>

167
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,200
Treat The Patient Like He's Any
Other Really, Really Ugly Kid.

168
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,100
Infection
Could Be Endocarditis.

169
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,400
Well, Since He Doesn't Have
A Prosthetic Heart Valve,

170
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,700
I Assume You're Thinking
He's An Iv Drug User?

171
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,000
House Said Assume He's Normal.

172
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,400
Dealers Don't Ask For I.D. And
Don't Care What You Look Like.

173
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,300
Nice. You're Right
About The Habit.

174
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,900
You're Wrong
About The Substance.

175
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,500
Blackened Skin
Under The Nose

176
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,500
 <I>Equals Frostbite</I>
 <I>From Huffing Freon.</I>

177
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,300
Freon's Toxic.
Damages The Heart.

178
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,700
Discoloration Could Be
Acanthosis Nigricans.

179
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,700
 <I>It's A Common Side Effect</I>
 <I>Of These Deformities.</I>

180
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,000
There's Also Discoloration
On The Cheeks And Forehead.

181
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,600
Do A Nuclear Study.

182
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,600
If I'm Right, You'll See
Scarring Of The Heart.

183
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,700
I'm Not Part
Of Some Game, Am I?

184
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,900
I Gave Up A Career Because
I Thought This Was A Firm Offer.

185
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,200
Yes.

186
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,900
This Is A Real Offer.

187
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,900
I Think
She Might Be An Idiot.

188
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,000
Who?

189
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,500
She Can't Be An Idiot.

190
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,900
She Was In The Cia,
For God's Sake.

191
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,500
The Bay Of Pigs
Was A Daring Triumph.

192
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,000
She Had Good Ideas
In Langley.

193
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,600
All Your Ideas.

194
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,100
She Was Able To Identify
That They Were Good Ideas.

195
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,800
Stab In The Dark Here.
Is She Pretty?

196
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,700
She's New.
She's Nervous.

197
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,500
She's A "C" Cup.

198
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,100
She Said One Dumb Thing
In A Differential.

199
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,000
They All Say Dumb Things
In Differentials.

200
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,800
A "D" Cup?
She's No Good.

201
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,600
Just Fire Her.

202
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,900
I Can't.

203
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,000
I Just Hired Her.

204
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,800
She Left A Career.

205
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,700
Wow.

206
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,000
You Know,
That's Actual Guilt,

207
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,000
Or I've Got To See
This Woman.

208
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,500
<I>My Son Is Not</I>
 <I>Huffing Freon.</I>

209
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,500
Mr. Arnold, Dr. House
Is Like A Savant

210
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,300
When It Comes
To Diagnostics.

211
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,000
 <I>What's His Genius</I>
 <I>Theory?</I>

212
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,100
Because Kenny's Not Normal,

213
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,300
He's Doing Drugs
To Deal With His Pain?

214
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,500
Maybe The Way
To Look At This

215
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,500
Is That You Are Normal.

216
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,000
And What's That
Supposed To Mean?

217
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You're Like
Any Other Parent

218
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,900
Who Thinks His Kid
Can't Be Doing Drugs.

219
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,400
We're Doing This 'Cause
My Dad Thinks I'm On Drugs?

220
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,100
I Was Doing Drugs
Behind My Parents' Back

221
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,300
At Your Age, And I Had
A Lot Less Reason To Be--

222
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,000
Not That Your Life
Must Be Miserable.

223
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,700
Not That I'm Suggesting
That You Should Be Doing Drugs.

224
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,600
 <I>How's School Going?</I>

225
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,600
I'm Homeschooled.

226
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,100
Really?
You're Lucky.

227
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,700
Going To School
Was Boring.

228
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,300
My Dad Took Me Out, And It
Wasn't 'Cause It Was Boring.

229
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,300
Well, I Had A Rough Time
In School Too.

230
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,100
Maybe Not Like You,
But, Uh...

231
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,700
You Know, I Mean, I Don't Mean
To Compare Our Situations.

232
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,200
Actually, I Guess I Am
Comparing Our Situations,

233
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,600
But Only To Show You
How Yours Is Worse.

234
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,200
You Can Edit That Out, Right?
So I Don't Look Like An Idiot.

235
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,100
Relax. Everyone Acts Like
An Idiot Around Me.

236
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,300
What Makes You Think
It's Not An Act?

237
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,600
Can I Have Something
For My Headache?

238
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,700
Yeah. Is That New?

239
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,700
16 Years Old.
Has The Same Birthday I Do.

240
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm Gonna Start
The Test Now.

241
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,300
 <I>Study Showed No Signs</I>
 <I>Of Scarring In Kenny's Heart.</I>

242
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,300
  <I>It Wasn't Drugs.</I>

243
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,600
Well, Then Give Me
Something Better?

244
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,200
What's Causing Heart Block?

245
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,300
Could Be Toxoplasmosis.

246
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,600
We Should Do An Lp
To Test For Infection.

247
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,100
If It Was Toxoplasmosis,

248
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,400
We Would Have Seen
Enlarged Lymphs.

249
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,700
And Because You're Not
Pretty Enough To Be An Idiot,

250
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,600
 <I>You Must Know That Already.</I>

251
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,700
 <I>Which Means You Just Said It</I>

252
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,800
Because You Wanna Do An Lp To
Look For Intracranial Pressure.

253
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,300
Because It Is
Intracranial Pressure.

254
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,500
Wait. I'm Not Done.

255
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,800
 <I>You Thought</I>
 <I>I Wouldn't Catch On,</I>

256
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,400
Which Means Either You Think
I'm An Idiot,

257
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,600
Which Is Flattering--
I'm Doing My Hair Differently--

258
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,400
 <I>The Kid's Got Headaches.</I>

259
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,100
He's Been Popping
Acetaminophen Like Peanuts.

260
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,800
 <I>How Could You Possibly</I>
 <I>Think That I Was Done?</I>

261
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,900
I Prefaced That With An Either.
It Needs An "Or."

262
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,700
 <I>Or</I> You Are An Idiot--
Which Is Possible.

263
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,700
I'm Not Great At Judging
Men's Looks.

264
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,000
The O.R.

265
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,800
 <I>And The Mri Room.</I>

266
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,400
Yes.

267
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,700
Dr. House
Frequently Conducts

268
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,100
Differential Diagnoses
In A Variety Of Places.

269
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,700
He Feels That A...
Change In Venue

270
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,500
Often Leads To A Change
In Thinking Processes.

271
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,600
I Have To Go Take Care
Of Something Else.

272
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,200
Just Let Me Do A Ct Scan,
See If I'm Right.

273
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,000
The Sooner We Fix
The Problem,

274
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,300
The Sooner We Can Get
To His Reconstructive Surgery.

275
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,900
Yeah, Who Cares If You're Dead?
It's How You Look.

276
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,500
Well, Since You've
Given Me Nothing Better,

277
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,600
We're Back To Drugs.

278
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,900
The One Thing
We Know It's Not.

279
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,900
Decreased Uptake
On The Membranous Septum.

280
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,600
Could Be An Artifact.
We Can Redo It, But--

281
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,900
Nothing's Nothing.
Do An Ep Study.

282
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,700
Ep Study Means We Have
To Stop This Kid's Heart.

283
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,800
I'll Set It Up.

284
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,700
You Have A Minute
To Be Disemboweled?

285
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,400
I'm Gonna Thread
This Catheter

286
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,200
Through Different Areas
In Your Heart,

287
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,500
And Once I've Found
The Right Pathway,

288
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,600
I'll Apply
Some Electrical Energy.

289
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,900
It'll Stop My Heart?

290
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,400
It Sounds Worse Than It Is.
You'll Be Fine.

291
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,600
Is It Gonna Hurt?

292
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,400
There'll Be Some Discomfort.

293
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,300
If You've Done Drugs,

294
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,300
I Understand.

295
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,400
Being Different's
Really Hard.

296
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,300
Kenny, Um...

297
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,000
It's More Important
For You To Get Better

298
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,700
Than To Worry About
Getting In Trouble.

299
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,500
If I Did Drugs, That Could
Explain My Heart Problem?

300
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,400
It Could.

301
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,100
Then You Can Do The Surgery
To Fix My Face?

302
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,300
That's Why We're Here.

303
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,900
You Know How
Famous People...

304
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,300
Everywhere They Go,
People Are Watching Them,

305
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,500
Staring?

306
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,800
They Never Have A Chance
To Just Be.

307
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,400
You Know, And A Lot Of Them
Turn To Drugs.

308
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,700
People Stare At <I>Them</I>
Because They're Beautiful,

309
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,800
But Me, They Just Stare.

310
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,700
You Okay?

311
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,900
I Need To Know
What Kind Of Drugs, Kenny,

312
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,300
And How Much.

313
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,700
Um, Coke, Mostly.
A Lot Of Coke.

314
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,200
And Then, Uh,
When I Run Out,

315
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,100
I Usually Go To Lsd,
Or, Uh, Or Acid.

316
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,700
Those Are The Same Thing.

317
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,200
They Are?

318
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,700
You Don't Do Drugs,
Do You?

319
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,500
I Drink From My Dad's
Liquor Cabinet--

320
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,800
We're Not Gonna Do
This Test.

321
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,300
no.

322
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,000
I Need You To Turn
On Your Side.

323
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,800
We Need To Intubate.

324
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,400
and i need some help here.

325
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,500
 <I>Too Bad You Guys</I>

326
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,500
 <I>Are Going</I>
 <I>For A Theatrical Release.</I>

327
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,800
Vomiting Blood Would Have Made
A Great Act Out.

328
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,400
Likely Causes.

329
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,400
Mallory-Weiss Tear.

330
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,900
No Pallor, No Melena.

331
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,300
Why Are You
Wearing A Tie?

332
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,300
Uh, I Always Wear Ties.

333
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,600
I'm A Doctor.

334
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,100
 <I>Please Don't Look</I>
 <I>At The Camera.</I>

335
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:03,900
Sorry.

336
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,300
Nasal Papilloma.

337
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,100
Hemorrhage Could Have
Overwhelmed The Heart.

338
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,500
 <I>Nice Lipstick.</I>

339
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,300
Thank You.

340
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,500
Bad Idea.

341
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,600
Hahemorrge
Came After The Block.

342
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,300
House, Let Them
Do Their Job.

343
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,400
Anybody Here More Interested
In The Medicine,

344
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,300
A Little Less Interested
In The Paparazzi?

345
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,400
Upper G.I. Bleed.

346
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,700
Could Be Something
He Ate Or Drank.

347
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,600
Maybe A Peptic Ulcer.

348
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,700
Good.

349
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,100
Except No Abdominal Pain.

350
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,600
 <I>Patient Hasn't Lost</I>
 <I>His Appetite,</I>

351
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,700
 <I>And The Last I Checked,</I>
 <I>The Gastrointestinal Tract</I>

352
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,200
 <I>Isn't Connected</I>
 <I>To The Heart.</I>

353
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,200
Yeah. But Other Than That,
Real Good.

354
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,200
Nasopharyngeal Angiofibrosis.

355
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,700
I Just Said
It Wasn't A Nasal Tumor.

356
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,600
 <I>Stomach Cancer.</I>
 <I>Tumor Causes Bleeding.</I>

357
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,300
Body's Reaction To The Tumor
Causes Paraneoplastic Syndrome

358
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,500
 <I>Which Leads</I>
 <I>To Heart Block.</I>

359
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,400
Finally! Someone Who Is Not
Just A Pretty Face.

360
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,100
 <I>You And Taub Run The Scope,</I>

361
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,000
find the tumor.

362
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,400
<I>Uh, Could Be Dangerous.</I>

363
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,000
If The Bleeding
Was Caused By Liver Failure

364
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,300
As The Result
Of The Intracranial Pressure--

365
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,700
Liver Is The One Organ

366
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,300
You Can't Ascribe
To Intracranial Pressure.

367
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,800
True.

368
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,100
Intracranial Pressure
 <I>Can</I> Cause Liver Problems.

369
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,100
It Causes An Increase
In The Cavernous Sinus Pressure

370
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,200
Which Causes Pressure
In The Superior Vena Cava

371
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,700
Which Shuts Down The Liver.

372
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,400
You Just Think
Of That?

373
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,300
No.

374
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,300
Then Why Didn't You
Say Anything--

375
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,400
Think It Would Change His Mind?
Not A Chance.

376
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,200
House Would Have Undercut Me,

377
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,300
Ordered Me To Do A Procedure
I Just Argued Against,

378
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,900
And Then I'd Look Like
A Hypocrite

379
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,300
In Front Of The Thousands
Of People

380
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,600
And Potential Future Employers
Watching This Film.

381
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,700
If You're Right,

382
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,300
And We Stick A Scope Back Down
A Kid With Liver Failure,

383
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,400
He Could Bleed Again.

384
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,000
I Know.

385
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,100
He Just Vomited Blood.

386
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,400
Isn't That Dangerous?

387
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,400
No. You're In Good Hands.

388
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,200
Okay.

389
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,100
All Right.

390
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,500
Well, It's Great How He
Rebounded From That Setback.

391
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,800
<I>What Setback?</I>

392
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,200
He Didn't Tell You
About The...

393
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,600
Well, It's His Right.

394
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,500
Records Were Sealed.

395
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,800
Personally, I Think
He Was Just Tapping His Foot

396
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,300
And Reaching For
The Toilet Paper.

397
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,400
Obviously,
It Was A Witch Hunt.

398
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,800
<I>Do You Think</I>
 <I>They Singled Him Out Because...</I>

399
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,600
No, Literally
A Witch Hunt.

400
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,200
Dr. House
Is A Practicing Wiccan.

401
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,400
It's A Beautiful Religion.
It's Very Caring.

402
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,700
<I>Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey.</I>

403
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,900
You Have An All-Access Pass
To The Case,

404
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,900
Not My Fave Five,
So Go.

405
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,100
 <I>Come On, Come On,</I>
 <I>Let's Go.</I>

406
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,100
I Think I'm Going Blind.

407
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,500
Hairy Palms Too?

408
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,000
She Said Something
Idiotic Again,

409
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,500
And I Didn't
Even Notice It.

410
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,200
Foreman Had To Point Out
That It Was Idiotic.

411
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,700
She's Making <I>Me</I> An Idiot.

412
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,100
That's Cute.
You Have A Crush.

413
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,000
No, I Think
It's Something Systemic.

414
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,700
Thirteen's Pretty.
You're Obviously Okay With Her.

415
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,200
She Killed A Patient.

416
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,400
The Bitch Is Pretty.

417
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,400
The Bitch Is A Bitch.

418
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,100
- Ask Her Out.
- The Bitch?

419
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,100
She's A Bitch.

420
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,800
No, The One That's
Making You An Idiot.

421
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,300
The Story Of Life--
Boy Meets Girl.

422
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,000
Boy Gets Stupid.

423
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Boy And Girl
Live Stupidly Ever After.

424
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,100
Pretty Girl Kill Again?

425
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,000
Nope. Elephant Boy
Just Vomiting Up Blood Again.

426
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,000
No Tumors
In The Patient's Stomach, So--

427
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,400
But The Scope
Caused Variceal Bleeding.

428
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,300
 <I>Took 20 Minutes</I>
 <I>Of Banding To Stop It.</I>

429
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,200
Taub Was Right
About The Liver Failure.

430
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,200
Yeah.

431
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,400
His Craniofacial Deformity

432
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,200
- <I>Is Causing Intracranial Pressure, just cause--</I>
- No.

433
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,400
Where Are The Nose Bleeds?

434
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,800
Where's The Labored
Breathing?

435
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,400
You're Right About Me
Being Wrong.

436
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,900
You're Wrong
About You Being Right.

437
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,500
I Need New Ideas.
Anybody.

438
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,700
Does It Bother You
That This Kid's Gonna Die

439
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,200
'Cause You Won't
Put Down That Camera?

440
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,400
At All, You Know?

441
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,000
Your People Should Be
Extra Motivated.

442
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,300
I'm Sure They All
Wanna Look Good In The Film.

443
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,800
No, 'Cause Now They're
Too Worried About Looking Bad.

444
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,500
<I>Dr. House, Heart Block</I>
 <I>Plus Liver Failure</I>

445
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,900
Could Mean Autoimmune.

446
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,500
Maybe Scleroderma.

447
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,600
Foreman,
Does That Make Sense?

448
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,200
Not Without Tight Skin
On The Hands,

449
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,700
Muscle Weakness,
And A 30-Year-Old Patient.

450
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,000
 <I>Liver Failure</I>

451
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,600
Plus Heart Block Could Be
A Mitochondrial Disorder.

452
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,100
Hey, Say What
She Just Said.

453
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,800
Liver Failure Plus Heart Block

454
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,800
Could Be A Mitochondrial
Disorder?

455
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,400
Go Look For Signs
Of Retinal Degeneration.

456
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,800
<I>No, It's Icp.</I>

457
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,900
You're Only
Gonna See Swelling.

458
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,600
Take Him With You,

459
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,500
So He Can See
The Degeneration Too.

460
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,900
So Before You Worked Here
In The E.R.,

461
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,300
You Worked For House,
Right?

462
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,300
Three And A Half Years.

463
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,200
Why Did You Leave?

464
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,100
Hey, I Don't Wanna
Be On Tv.

465
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,400
I'm Not Signing
A Release.

466
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,500
We'll Blur You Out.

467
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,700
Take Off Your Pants.

468
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,200
You Gonna Be Able
To Use Any Of This

469
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,300
If I Start Swearing?

470
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,900
Did House Treat You As Badly

471
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,700
As He Treats
His Current Fellows?

472
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,100
Loaded Question.

473
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,100
Fawwwrk!

474
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,600
That's Not Even A Word.

475
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,500
Fork!

476
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,000
Very Clever.

477
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,500
I Learned How To Be
A Doctor From House.

478
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,300
Or At Least A Doctor Who Learned
How To Be A Doctor From House,

479
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,400
If That Makes Any Sense.

480
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,200
Any You Left His Team
Because

481
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,300
 <I>You Couldn't</I>
 <I>Stand Him Anymore?</I>

482
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,500
No, No.
I...I Love Dr. House.

483
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,300
That's Something
We Haven't Heard.

484
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,500
I Mean...

485
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,300
What Did You
Ask Me Again?

486
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,000
 <I>Why You Left.</I>

487
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:34,900
I...I Loved Being
Around Him...

488
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,100
Professionally, You Know.

489
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,600
It Was Always...
Stimulating.

490
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,100
Not In An Erotic Sense
Of The Word.

491
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,000
Fork.

492
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,500
They Forked.
And Then They Spooned.

493
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,100
Lean Forward And Place
Your Chin On The Rest.

494
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,500
I Can't Reach It.

495
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,000
Uh, Scooch In
A Little.

496
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,500
I'll Take Care
Of It.

497
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,900
Just Like Last Time?

498
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,300
Maybe We Should Try This
The Old-Fashioned Way, Hmm?

499
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,500
Okay, Look Up To The Ceiling

500
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,200
And Try Not To Blink, Okay?

501
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,900
Okay, Good.
Now Straight Ahead.

502
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,200
There It Is.

503
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,500
Swelling.
No Degeneration.

504
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,400
It's Not Mitochondrial.

505
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,800
Swelling Proves There's
Increased Pressure In His Brain.

506
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,800
Absolutely.

507
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,700
So Now We Can Schedule
The Reconstruction.

508
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,900
Absolutely Not.

509
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,700
Your Test Proved You Wrong.

510
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,500
We Found Exactly
What I Predicted We'd Find.

511
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,600
Swelling Means
There's Increased Pressure.

512
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,300
You Get A Gold Star
Of David

513
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,200
For Proving That, Yes,
This Kid Has A Big Head,

514
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,700
And Big Heads
Cause Pressure.

515
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,000
But It Doesn't
Explain The Liver.

516
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,400
Too Much Acetaminophen Does.

517
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,300
Jra Explains All Of It,
Including The Liver.

518
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,800
One Theory's Better Than Two.
Treat With Steroids.

519
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,600
If You're Wrong,

520
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,500
Steroids Are Gonna Mess
With His Immune System,

521
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,200
Put Off His Surgery
For Months.

522
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,900
You Really Wanna Lose
This Argument

523
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,000
In Front Of The Camera?

524
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,700
I'll Speak
To The Father.

525
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,000
Dr. House Believes
That Kenny Has Jra,

526
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,900
Juvenile Rheumatoid
Arthritis.

527
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,000
We Need To Start
Administering Steroids.

528
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,200
Will The Steroids
Fix It?

529
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,400
I Don't Think
He Has Jra.

530
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,800
I Think Dr. House
Is Wrong

531
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,800
And That The Steroid Treatment
Could Be Dangerous.

532
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,500
I Think I Can Get House
Thrown Off The Case,

533
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,700
And Get Kenny
The Facial Surgery He Needs.

534
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,400
The Father Refused Steroids

535
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,300
Until We're Sure
About The Diagnosis.

536
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,000
I Am Sure.
It's Jra.

537
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,800
And Why Would He Even
Doubt That,

538
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,200
Unless A Former Fellow Of Mine
Was Chirping In His Ear.

539
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,400
The Decision Was His.
I Merely Voiced My Concern.

540
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,500
Why'd You Take
This Job?

541
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,800
He's Got A Bulging Cyst.

542
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,600
You Had A Perfectly Good
Plastic Surgery Practice,

543
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,100
Lots Of Money.

544
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,600
Fluids Aren't Draining
Properly.

545
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,100
 <I>Temptation To Come Screw</I>
 <I>With Me</I>

546
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,400
Just Too Much For You?

547
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,600
There's Gotta Be
A Better Reason.

548
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,100
He Needs Surgery
To Drain It.

549
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,000
Oh, And I Think I Mentioned
This Earlier--You're Fired.

550
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,200
What You Did
Was Over The Line.

551
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,000
Get Out.

552
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,300
But Don't Go Anywhere.
You're Not Fired.

553
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:28,800
Yet.

554
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,300
No One Is Firing Anyone
In The Middle Of This Case.

555
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,600
Not While
Those Cameras Are Here,

556
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,800
And Not While Taub Is The Only
Person That This Father Trusts.

557
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,200
Where Are You Going?

558
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,300
To Do What I Always Do
In These Situations--

559
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,900
Treat My Patient
Behind His Back.

560
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,500
That's One Option.

561
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,100
Or You Can Do A Ct Scan
Of The Kid's Head.

562
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,300
 <I>If There's No Midline Shift,</I>
 <I>We Know Taub Was Wrong,</I>

563
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:54,100
And You Get Your Consent
To Give The Kid Steroids.

564
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,700
Just A Warning.

565
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,200
We Have To Start
Getting Consent

566
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,800
Every Time
We Do A Procedure,

567
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,300
Soon They'll Be Asking
For Informed Consent.

568
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 <I>Didn't Think You Had The Guts</I>
 <I>To Stage A Coup.</I>

569
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Coup Failed.

570
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,100
I'm Scheduled For Execution
At Dawn.

571
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,000
No, You're Not.

572
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,700
No Reprieve
From The Governor.

573
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:19,600
You're A Test Result Away From
Becoming House's Frontrunner.

574
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,300
 <I>He Doesn't Care About</I>

575
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,200
What You Said Or What You Did
Five Minutes Ago.

576
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,800
He Just Wants
The Next Good Idea.

577
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,600
Show Me 20% Magnification
Of The Forebrain.

578
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,000
I Look At Our Patient...

579
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,400
Soon As I Saw His Face,

580
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,200
I Saw A Regular Kid.

581
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,600
 <I>One Thing About Being</I>
 <I>A Plastic Surgeon--</I>

582
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,400
You Don't See What Is,

583
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,700
You See What Could Be.

584
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,200
You Talk Like That
Around House,

585
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,400
Doesn't Matter How Many
Good Ideas You Come Up With.

586
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,800
So...

587
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,600
Tell Me What You Don't
Like About Yourself.

588
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,800
Gosh, Uh...

589
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,900
There's So Many Things.

590
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,500
Uh, Is Dr. Taub Available?

591
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,200
Because He Was
Very Highly Recommended.

592
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,100
Well, He's No Longer
Practicing With Us,

593
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,700
But I've Taken Over
All His Files

594
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,800
So If You Tell Me
What Needs Work--

595
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,100
Do You Know Why He Left?

596
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,900
He Had Personal Issues To Deal
With, So If We Could Just--

597
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,700
Oh, My Goodness.
Is He Okay?

598
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,900
Oh, Yeah, He's Fine.

599
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,200
'Cause My Friend Had His Ears
Done By Dr. Taub.

600
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,700
Should He Worry
That They May...Pop Back?

601
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,300
No, It Wasn't
A Professional Issue.

602
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,400
I'm Sorry I Really Can't Go
Into More Detail.

603
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,100
Shall We Discuss
 <I>Your</I> Needs?

604
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,800
You Know That Toe
Next To The Big Toe?

605
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,400
Mine's Bigger
Than My Big Toe.

606
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,700
Is There Any Way
To Shorten It?

607
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,700
Or Make My Big Toe Bigger,
Like A Toe-Gmentation?

608
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,900
Did He Lie, Cheat,
Or Steal?

609
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
You're Not Here
For A Consultation, Are You?

610
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,900
What Gave Me Away?

611
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,300
Was It My Obviously
Perfect Feet?

612
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,700
Hi.

613
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,200
Ct Shows--

614
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,300
Let's Go.

615
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,300
What Are You Two
Doing Here?

616
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,700
Skipping Three Scenes.
Ct's Back.

617
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,700
He's Gonna Say That There's
Evidence Of An Anomaly.

618
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,700
I'm Gonna Say He's Wrong.

619
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,700
He's Gonna Go Back
To The Father,

620
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,100
And We'll All
End Up Here.

621
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,000

Defect Is Pushing
On The Right Frontal Lobe.

622
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,600
This Bend Is A Sign
Of Herniation.

623
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,100
Or It's A Sign
Of Increased Pressure From Jra.

624
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,900
Dr. Taub Would Rather
Distract You From The Truth

625
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:23,400
With Sparkly Things
Like 4-Carat Diamonds.

626
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,500
House.

627
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,900
Your Partner Said That You Left
For Personal Reasons.

628
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,500
But Your Wife Said
You Lost A Patient.

629
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,400
Son Of A Bitch.
You Spoke To My Wife?

630
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,600
See, That Confused Me.

631
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,000
Why Would You Give Her
A Diamond

632
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,600
If You Screwed
Somebody Else Over?

633
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,800
If You Screwed <I>Her</I> Over,
I Mean, I Could--

634
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,000
Get That Camera Out Of Here.

635
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,700
You Say Anything
To Her?

636
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,800
Just Asked Questions.

637
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,000
Get Them
Out Of Here Too.

638
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,300
We're Doctors.

639
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,600
I Screwed Around
With A Nurse.

640
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,400
It Became A Deal.

641
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,300
My Partners Found Out,
And I Resigned.

642
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,400
There. Happy?

643
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,200
If You Could Be
A Bit More Descriptive,

644
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,600
I'd Be Happier.

645
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,200
Some People Pop
Pain Pills.

646
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,100
I Cheat.

647
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,200
We All Have Our Vices.

648
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 <I>Taub.</I>

649
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,800
I Don't See It.

650
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,100
Stay Away From The Family.

651
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,600
House, Start Steroids,
And Stay Away From His Family.

652
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,400
Wow. You Are Ugly.

653
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,900
 <I>Wow.</I>

654
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,300
You're An Ass.

655
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,900
I Have A Deformity.

656
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,000
I Know. that's why
You're Ugly.

657
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
But You're A Lucky Boy.

658
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,700
Anywhere Else
In The Animal Kingdom,

659
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,600
Your Parents Would Have
Eaten You At Birth.

660
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,800
 <I>Your Son Needs Steroids.</I>

661
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,600
Dr. Cuddy Agrees.

662
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,000
Does Dr. Taub?

663
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,800
He's...Not A Real Doctor.

664
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,000
He's A Plastic Surgeon.

665
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,200
All He Cares Is That Your Son
Looks Good In His Coffin.

666
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,700
So I'm Supposed
To Believe You.

667
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,900
The Doctor Who Cares.

668
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,600
You Shouldn't Care
If I Care.

669
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,000
I Don't Trust You.

670
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,500
Because I Don't Think
The Surgery's Important?

671
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,200
You're Putting Your Trust
In Someone

672
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,100
Who <I>Does</I> Think
The Surgery's Important.

673
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,100
You're Willing To Take Chances,

674
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,300
 <I>To Risk His Life</I>
 <I>For Something He Doesn't Need.</I>

675
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,800
I Do Need It.

676
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,700
I Can't Have
Real Relationships.

677
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,200
I Can't Even Have
A Real Conversation.

678
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,000
Not Even With My Dad.

679
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,600
Dad...

680
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,900
I Know You Love Me.

681
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,300
But You Don't
Treat Me Normal.

682
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,400
You're Always Protective.

683
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,000
The World
Can Always Go To Hell.

684
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,500
 <I>But You Never Yell</I>
 <I>At Me...</I>

685
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,100
Even When <I>I</I> Screw Up.

686
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,000
I Wanna Be Normal.

687
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,200
Take Your Steroids.

688
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,800
You Get To Live.

689
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,900
Then You Can Do
Your Surgery.

690
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,700
And It'll Only Change
Your Face.

691
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,600
It Won't Change
Who Your Face Made You.

692
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,700
We're Gonna Get Caught.

693
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,000
Not On Film.

694
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
All Their Camera
Equipment's In Here.

695
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,800
Where Did You Get
Those Keys?

696
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,100
Blue, The Janitor.

697
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,100
What?

698
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,200
That's His Name.

699
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,500
His Name's Lou.

700
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,100
Owe Him An Apology.

701
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,400
Just Watch
20 Minutes Of The Stuff.

702
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,800
Tell Me If
I'm Out Of My Mind.

703
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,100
Finally,
We Have Video Evidence.

704
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,800
 <I>Dr. House, Heart Block</I>
 <I>Plus Liver Failure</I>

705
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,200
 <I>Could Mean Autoimmune,</I>
 <I>Maybe Scleroderma.</I>

706
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,700
<I>Foreman, Does That</I>
 <I>Make Sense?</I>

707
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,300
<I>Not Without Tight Skin</I>
 <I>On The Hands,</I>

708
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:05,200
 <I>Muscle Weakness,</I>
 <I>And A 30-Year-Old Patient.</I>

709
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,000
Can I See That Again?

710
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,100
What Did You Miss?

711
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,100
She Screwed Up.
I Didn't--

712
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,600
No, Just The Part
Where She Leans Forward.

713
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,800
I Think You Can
See Through Her Dress.

714
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,600
 <I>Upper Gi Bleed.</I>

715
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,600
 <I>Could Be From Something</I>
 <I>He Ate Or Drank.</I>

716
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,500
- <I>Maybe A Peptic Ulcer.</I>
- <I>Good.</I>

717
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,700
You...Thought That Was
A Good Idea?

718
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,200
What Am I Gonna Do?

719
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,200
Just Enjoy.

720
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,700
I'm Gonna Keep Her Around
Because She Makes Me An Idiot?

721
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,200
Well, You're Protected.
Foreman Seems Immune.

722
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,600
You Think He's Gay?

723
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,400
Did He Become An Idiot
Around Chase?

724
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,000
 <I>Nasopharyngeal</I>
 <I>Angiofibroma.</I>

725
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,500
 <I>I Just Said It's Not</I>
 <I>A Nasal Tumor.</I>

726
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,700
Wait A Minute.
Rewind That.

727
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,100
Was That <I>Thirteen?</I>

728
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,100
Wow.

729
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,500
I Can't Believe
I'm That Guy.

730
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,200
Every Guy Is That Guy.

731
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,600
I'm Not Every Guy.

732
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,000
What,
Is This Semantics Here?

733
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,200
Okay--All Guys
Are That Guy.

734
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,800
I'm Not All Guys.

735
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,600
Cameron Was Smart.

736
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,600
You Know, I'm...
Beginning To Doubt That.

737
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,600
I Wanted To Clarify
Something I Said Earlier--

738
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,400
"I Love Dr. House."

739
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,200
And Then I Qualified It,

740
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,500
Which, After Thinking
About It,

741
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,300
I Didn't Really
Need To Do.

742
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,300
I Did <I>Love</I> Being
Around Him.

743
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,100
I Guess I Just Wanted
To Qualify

744
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,400
What I Qualified Before.

745
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,600
I'm Looking Defensive,
Aren't I?

746
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,400
No, No, I Think That's Great.
Clears Everything Up.

747
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,800
It's No Big Deal, Really.

748
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,200
There's A Mass Lesion

749
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,300
In The Left Anterior Temporal
Lobe Surrounded By Edema.

750
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,400
Did You Just Insult Me
In Pig Latin?

751
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,500
Dr. House, Please.

752
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,000
Would You Just Take
A Look At This?

753
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,600
The Defect Is Causing
This Nodular Shadow Here.

754
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,500
You See It?

755
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,300
You're Right.

756
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,600
I Didn't See That Before.

757
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,300
Come On, Let's Go.

758
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,100
Hey.

759
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,600
 <I>I Know You Think</I>
 <I>You're Feeling Better</I>

760
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,300
On Account Of Feeling Better.

761
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,500
But This Trusted
Family Doctor

762
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,800
 <I>Thinks That He's Found</I>
 <I>A Mass Lesion.</I>

763
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,500
So If You Could
Lie Back Down

764
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,100
And Struggle To Breathe--

765
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:33,900
Okay.

766
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,200
You Were Right.

767
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,000
I'm Thrilled I'm Wrong.

768
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,900
This Is Great, Kenny.

769
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,500
You're Gonna Get
Your Surgery Now.

770
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,200
First Person
I'm Coming Back To See Is You.

771
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,800
'Cause Compared To Me,
You're Gonna Look Like Butt.

772
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,800
Hey.

773
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,400
What, No Comeback?

774
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,900
Look At That.

775
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,200
What?

776
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,000
His Little Finger.
It's Twitching.

777
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,300
No, It's Not.
Just Give It A Second.

778
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,400
- <I>There.</I>
- <I>And?</I>

779
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,200
He's Not Better.

780
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,100
What's Wrong?

781
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,400
My Diagnosis.

782
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,200
I Don't Know
What He Has.

783
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,800
Cancel The Surgery.

784
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,900
Involuntary
Muscle Movement.

785
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,500
A Twitching Finger
Is A Symptom?

786
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,200
The Body Doing Something
It's Not Supposed To Do

787
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,800
Is The Definition
Of A Symptom.

788
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,700
Kid's About To Have
A Life-Changing Operation.

789
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,500
He's Nervous.

790
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,500
Or He's Not.

791
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,700
<I>Or You Were Right.</I>

792
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,800
The Kid Got Better
When We Put Him On Steroids.

793
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,000
This Is Jra,
And It's Under Control Now.

794
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:47,900
 <I>Or The Steroids</I>

795
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,500
Have Just Tempered
His Condition.

796
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,600
He Had A Haircut,

797
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,800
 <I>Still Got Bad Hair.</I>

798
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,000
What About Lyme Disease?

799
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 <I>It Explains Everything--</I>

800
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,100
 <I>The Heart Issues,</I>
 <I>Internal Bleeding,</I>

801
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,500
Even Why It'd Get Better
On Steroids.

802
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,000
On The Other Hand,
If He Has Lyme Disease,

803
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,800
There Would Be
Other Subtle Clues,

804
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,900
Like A Huge,
Target-Shaped Rash.

805
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:04,800
 <I>But Thanks</I>
 <I>For Playing.</I>

806
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,000
Why Can't You Just
Accept The Fact

807
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,300
 <I>That You Cured This Kid?</I>

808
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,900
 <I>You Want To Stop</I>
 <I>His Surgery.</I>

809
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,400
You're Not Normal,

810
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,300
So You Don't Want Anybody Else
To Be Normal.

811
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,200
You Don't Think
Normal's Healthy.

812
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,300
 <I>could be Rheumatic Fever.</I>

813
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,000
Also Explains
Why The Steroids Helped.

814
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,600
It's A Similar
Inflammatory Disease.

815
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,600
Rheumatic Fever
Doesn't Explain Liver Failure.

816
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,600
Taub Thinks
That Acetaminophen Does.

817
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,100
<I>Fine. Let's Test</I>
 <I>Your Theory.</I>

818
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,600
Remove His Pacing Wire.

819
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,000
If He's Better, His Heart'll
Beat Just Fine On Its Own,

820
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
And Then He Can Have
His Operation.

821
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,900
<I>If I'm Right,</I>
 <I>His Heart Will Stop.</I>

822
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,100
Kutner, Have The Paddles
On Standby.

823
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,200
Another Chance
To Blow Someone Up.

824
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,300
There'll Be Some
Minor Discomfort,

825
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,600
And You'll Feel A Slow,
Steady Pulling Sensation.

826
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,700
Are You Sure His Heart
Is Ready For This?

827
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,800
<I>Absolutely.</I>

828
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,700
He's Convinced He's Sure.

829
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,400
Whereas...
I Care About Your Son

830
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:09,000
And Have, Therefore, Brought
A Professional Defibrillist.

831
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,200
We're Not Gonna Need Those.

832
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,200
Dad, I Feel Fine.

833
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,000
My Finger Hasn't Moved
In A While.

834
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,000
Okay.

835
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:27,600
Take Him Off.

836
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,400
Here We Go.

837
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,700
Heart Rate's
85 Beats Per Minute.

838
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,500
Bp 110 Over 70.

839
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,900
Is He Okay?

840
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,700
I Feel The Same.

841
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:01,900
He's Fine.

842
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,400
 <I>You're Fine.</I>

843
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,300
Thank God!

844
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,500
What Do You Mean,
Thank God?

845
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,100
God's The Guy
Who Gave It To Him.

846
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,600
Thank You.

847
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,200
Thank You.

848
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,900
Can You Tell Us
About The Procedure?

849
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:15,400
We Have To Use Both An Extra
And Intracranial Approach

850
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,700
To Get Enough Exposure

851
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,700
To Reduce
The Encephalocele Cyst

852
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,300
And Do The Bony Reconstruction.

853
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,200
And How Are You Participating
In The Procedure?

854
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,200
She's Not.

855
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,600
They Don't Want Me Here,

856
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,400
Because They Think
The Kid's cured.

857
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,100
I Don't.

858
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,600
And What Do You Think
The Problem Is?

859
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,300
Wish I Knew.

860
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,200
I Just Know That
If Dr. House Is Right,

861
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,600
Something's Gonna Go Wrong.

862
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,700
Dr. House Doesn't
Think He's Right.

863
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,100
Well, Then, I'll Just Waste
A Few Hours Watching A Surgery.

864
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,100
The Danger Is
We Have To Reconstruct

865
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,300
All The Way Down
To The Cranial Base.

866
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,600
And There Are
Some Big Vessels Down There.

867
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,900
So What We'll Do Is We'll
Work Our Way Down To Here--

868
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,300
When Were
These Pictures Taken?

869
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,200
About...Three Weeks Ago.

870
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,500
Why? What Do You See?

871
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,000
 <I>The Acanthosis Nigricans</I>
 <I>Was Already There.</I>

872
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,300
It's Been There
A Lot Longer Than That.

873
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,800
Probably His Whole Life.

874
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,100
What About
Around His Hairline?

875
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,300
What? There's
No Discoloration.

876
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,300
There Is Now.

877
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,200
I Have A New Theory.

878
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,800
Their Bad Ideas Don't Indicate
A Lack Of Intelligence.

879
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,800
It Indicates An Open Mind,

880
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,100
The Willingness Not
To Be Trapped By Conventional--

881
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
You've Got A Problem.

882
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,400
Tell Me Something
I Don't Know.

883
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,500
You Hire Beautiful Girls,
Enslave Them,

884
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,800
Force Them
To Be Around You,

885
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,800
Because You Don't Know How
To Have An Actual Relationship.

886
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,400
If They're Qualified,
Keep Them.

887
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,700
If Not,
Fire Them And Ask Them Out.

888
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,400
 <I>You Do Realize That "Tell Me</I>
 <I>Something I Don't Know"</I>

889
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,000
Is Just An Expression.

890
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,200
Thirteen--

891
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,000
You Think That Just Because
She's As Beautiful,

892
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,600
- <I>Ergo...</I>
- No.

893
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,300
You Think That Because
She Hasn't Had A Decent Idea--

894
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,000
No, My Point Is She's
About To Enter Your Office,

895
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,200
So You Should Shut Up.

896
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,700
You Were Right
About The Diagnosis.

897
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:03,000
Yes. It Was Jra.
I'm Very Proud.

898
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,300
No, I Mean You Were Right
About Being Wrong.

899
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,200
He's Got Lyme Disease.
It Explains Everything.

900
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,800
Could You Just
Hold Up Some Fingers

901
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,100
So I Can See
If I'm Literally Blind?

902
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,600
 <I>We Ruled Out Lyme Disease</I>
 <I>Hours Ago.</I>

903
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,800
All The Symptoms Fit.

904
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,200
I Am So Ashamed.
Is She Really That Good-Looking?

905
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,300
Apparently.

906
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,300
How Many Lives Have Been Lost
Because Of Pretty Girls?

907
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,800
The Target Rash
Is Hiding.

908
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,300
No One Ever Looked At Him
Closely Enough.

909
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,300
She's Getting Uglier
By The Second.

910
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,600
We Can Try And Pretend
We're Above It.

911
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,300
We Can Try
And Intellectualize It Away,

912
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:16,500
But Ultimately,
Shiny, Pretty, Perky Things

913
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,400
Are Good,

914
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:22,700
And Ugly, Misshapen
Teenage Boys Are Repulsive.

915
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,100
 <I>The Question Was</I>

916
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:29,600
 <I>Do You Resent Dr. Cuddy's</I>
 <I>Interference In Your Practice?</I>

917
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,500
Oh!

918
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,200
Well, Then I Guess My Answer
Wasn't Very Helpful, Was It?

919
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,300
Mini-Stud, Stand Up.

920
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,200
I Spoke To Your
Other Partner.

921
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,200
- After Cuddy Told You--
- No, I Stayed Away.

922
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,500
 <I>Did It All</I>
 <I>Over The Phone.</I>

923
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,600
I Asked For A Reference,

924
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,500
Said You Were Applying
For A Plastic Surgery Job.

925
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,900
Oh, God!

926
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,900
Yeah.

927
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,200
He Went Nuts.

928
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,000
 <I>Apparently,</I>
 <I>You Signed A Non-Compete.</I>

929
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,200
Now, Why Would You
Agree To That?

930
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,900
I Don't Wanna Practice
Plastic Surgery.

931
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,700
No. You Sign A Contract
Because Someone's Making You.

932
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,500
Someone's Getting Something
From You.

933
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,100
What Did They
Give You In Return?

934
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,500
They Agreed
To Keep Their Mouths Shut.

935
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,900
<I>So You Gave Up</I>
 <I>Your Chosen Career</I>

936
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,200
Just So They'd Be Quiet?

937
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,100
I Love My Wife.

938
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:40,700
And You Risked This Job
With Nothing To Fall Back On?

939
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,900
I Thought You Were Wrong.

940
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,600
Sit Back Down.

941
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,400
You're Keeping Him
Because He's A Philanderer?

942
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,600
 <I>Where Do I Sign Up?</I>

943
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,000
Ask The Mormon.

944
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,200
 <I>I'm Keeping Him</I>
 <I>Because He's Interesting.</I>

945
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,800
Dr. Terzi,
Would You Please Stand Up?

946
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:11,900
Nice.

947
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,000
I Have Treated You
Unfairly.

948
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,500
Prejudged You.

949
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,600
And For Me To Be
A Better Person,

950
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,600
I Have To Rectify
That Situation.

951
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,700
You're Fired.

952
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,800
You Wanna...
Grab Some Dinner?

953
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:34,800
Maybe A Movie?

954
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,700
Seriously.

955
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,000
Just Days Ago, With Kenny's
Condition Worsening,

956
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:58,000
It Was Dr. Gregory House
Reassuring Kenny And His Father.

957
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,100
I Care About Your Son.

958
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:03,200
<I>The Charming House,</I>
 <I>Who Happens To Be A Film Buff</I>

959
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,100
 <I>With A Soft Spot</I>
 <I>In His Heart For Children,</I>

960
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,500
 <I>Told Us</I>
 <I>How He Got His Start.</I>

961
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:09,200
See, I Became A Doctor Because
Of The Movie <I>Patch Adams.</I>

962
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,200
 <I>Determined To Save</I>
 <I>The Boy's Life as well as...</I>

963
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,800
The Horror...

964
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,000
Well, It's Nice Of Them
To Send Us An Early Copy.

965
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,700
Not So Much Sent As Stolen.

966
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:21,400
In The End,
It Was Dr. Gregory House

967
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,900
Who Served As Not Only A Doctor,

968
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,200
But A Rock
For Kenny And His Father.

969
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,500
You're Putting Your Trust
In Someone

970
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,300
Who <I>Does</I> Think
The Surgery's Important.

971
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,400
 <I>House, One Of Those</I>
 <I>Rare Doctors---</I>

972
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,300
God--

973
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,000
 <I>Wears His Heart</I>
 <I>On His Sleeve</I>

974
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,600
I Was Saying That Was
A <I>Stupid</I> Thing To Do.

975
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,400
It's Difficult
Not To Be Moved.

976
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,600
Oh, Stop It.

977
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,300
 <I>Suddenly I Don't Feel Like</I>

978
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,400
I Can Trust
Michael Moore Movies.

979
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:45,900
Where Are You Going?

980
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,200
Kittens
To Get Out Of Trees?

981
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,900
 <I>Deaf Kids</I>
 <I>To Read To?</I>

982
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,500
I Owe It To The World

983
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,100
To Make Sure This Evil
Never Sees The Light Of Day.

984
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,000
 <I>Is there Anything Else, Kenny?</I>

985
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:05,900
Thank You, Dr. House.

986
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,500
 <I>Thank You.</I>
