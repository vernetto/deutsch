1
00:00:02,802 --> 00:00:05,498
So now the plan is
either find ourselves
a new counselor,

2
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:08,166
stick it out with the old one,
but go more often,

3
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:11,074
or resign ourselves to the fact
that she's never gonna be happy...

4
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:16,013
no matter what I do, so let's take
the money we're wasting and put it
towards a membership at Lakeview.

5
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:19,210
I'm guessing the last
option has yet to be formally presented.
Yeah.

6
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:22,254
Geez. What's with you?
You usually run half speed
to stay with me.

7
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:26,122
Didn't get a lot of sleep last night.

8
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:30,560
How are things with Elyse?
Great.

9
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,894
Great?
Yeah.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,969
One-syllable answers.
You're either out of breath,
or you're lying to me.

11
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:41,474
Yeah. We have our moments,
but they usually work out.

12
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,772
Man, you got some water?
Yeah.

13
00:00:44,844 --> 00:00:46,869
So how do you work things out?

14
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:50,447
I don't know.
We talk, someone apologizes.

15
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:52,542
Man, I shouldn't have
drank last night.

16
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:56,248
- Hey, you mean you apologize.
- Yeah, I guess.

17
00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:59,553
- How often do you guys have sex?
- Enough.

18
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:01,685
You do it this morning?

19
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:03,786
You did.
You did it this morning.

20
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:07,492
Maybe that's why
you can't stand up, huh? Come on.

21
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,559
Elyse.

22
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:15,607
Great.

23
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:17,802
Honey, I'm dehydrated.

24
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:20,471
Do we have anything
with electrolytes?

25
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,009
Sleeping Beauty, wake up.

26
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:28,577
This is an emergency.

27
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:30,623
The fridge is empty.

28
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,250
Come on.
It's almost 4:00.

29
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:38,228
Elyse. Sweetie.

30
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:43,327
Call Jacques.
Tell him I'm not feeling well.

31
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:47,635
It's Saturday.
You haven't been to work
in three days. Remember?

32
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:50,835
Just let me sleep.

33
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:54,004
Come on.
You haven't been out of bed
since Wednesday.

34
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,106
- Leave me alone.
- Come on. What's up?

35
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:59,651
No. Leave me alone.

36
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:02,449
Honey.
I said leave me alone!

37
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:13,332
Oh. I think there's
something wrong with me.

38
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:50,435
She's been averaging 18 hours of sleep
a day since her admission.

39
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,700
Clinical depression.
Incredibly contagious.

40
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:57,140
Every time I'm around
one of them, I get blue.
It's not clinical depression.

41
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,338
Great.
Got it all figured out.
You don't need me.

42
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:05,707
Three E.R. doctors, two neurologists
and a radiologist have all
figured out what it's not.

43
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:08,618
We need to figure out what it is.
If any of the above-mentioned
doctors...

44
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,350
were interested in my opinion,
they would have asked for it.

45
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:14,018
None of them are willing
to subject themselves to you.

46
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:16,084
No pain, no gain.

47
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:19,029
The blood work shows
no signs of inflammation,

48
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:21,794
and no one can figure out
what's actually the cause--
Ah.

49
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:26,100
What?
Husband described her as being
unusually irritable recently.

50
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:30,836
And?
I didn't realize it was possible for
a woman to be unusually irritable.

51
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,611
Nice try, but you're a misanthrope,
not a misogynist.

52
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:40,585
What's the first thing
you ask a doctor
who's referring a patient?

53
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:43,247
Are you questioning my ability
to take a history?

54
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:47,118
What's the primary--
Not "What." "Why?".

55
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:50,492
Diseases don't have motives.
No, but doctors do.

56
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,690
Why this patient?
What interests you?

57
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,729
Give me the chart.
Why?

58
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:00,871
I find your interest interesting.

59
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:06,537
She's irritable and sleeping
18 hours a day.

60
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:08,547
What's interesting about that?

61
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:11,675
Hypersomnia's usually accompanied
by irritability in depressed patients.

62
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,049
True, but not relevant.
She's not depressed.

63
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,146
Hello. She's sleeping
18 hours a day.
Fever.

64
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:19,214
Clinical depression
does not cause fever.

65
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:21,726
- She could be sick and depressed.
- She's sick.

66
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:23,728
Oh, damn it.
Why didn't I think of that?

67
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:26,697
- Yeah, that's what I meant.
- Elevated sed rate indicates inflammation.

68
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,326
Hypersomnia and personality changes
point toward the brain.

69
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:31,063
Not the spleen?

70
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:33,230
Thank goodness we hired
a neurologist.

71
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,331
Brain symptoms. Hmm.
Could this be a brain problem?

72
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:37,899
No other systemic signs of inflammation.
Probably not vasculitis.

73
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:40,673
What about parasites?
Malaria, Chagas.

74
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:43,875
But the patient's never been outside of
the United States-- especially the tropics.

75
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,976
- You mean she claims
she's never been outside the U.S.
- Very good.

76
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:49,749
Doesn't matter.
Blood and C.S.F. smears
show no sign of parasites.

77
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:53,417
- Has to be a tumor then.
- A tumor sitting directly
on top of the brain stem...

78
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:56,428
that three E.R. doctors,
two neurologists
and a radiologist missed?

79
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:59,329
Partridge in a pear tree
missed it too.

80
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:03,529
Redo the blood work, and get a new M.R.I.
with two-millimeter cuts
through the mesodiencephalic.

81
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,537
And check for evil stepmothers.

82
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:07,539
This much sleep
usually indicates poison apples.

83
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:11,938
Anything else besides
the shortness of breath?

84
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:14,878
Not really.
It's actually just kind of a tightness.

85
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:16,915
You smoke?
No, never.

86
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,247
- Exercise?
- Eight hours a day.

87
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:23,121
- I teach preschool.
- Sounds fun.

88
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:27,719
Any history of heart disease
in your family?

89
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:30,228
Not that I know of.
Take a deep breath.

90
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:36,268
Been under
a lot of stress lately?
No more than usual.

91
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,203
You're probably just a little anemic.

92
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:41,263
I'm gonna do an E.K.G.
just to make sure.

93
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,799
Do I need to take this off?
Uh, no. You can just
pull that down in front.

94
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,251
Good Lord.

95
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:57,119
- Are those real?
- Do they look real?

96
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,158
They look pretty damn good.

97
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:01,216
They were a present
for my husband's 40th.

98
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,387
I figured he'd enjoy them
more than a sweater.

99
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,691
That's so sweet.

100
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:10,668
But I'm afraid the cause of your problem
could be staring us right in the face.

101
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,967
Actually, I guess
I'm the one doing the staring.

102
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,406
Ofcourse, I can't be sure.
I'd like to consult a colleague.

103
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:19,172
He's actually somewhat
of an expert in these matters.

104
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:23,973
Can I get a page on Dr. Wilson?

105
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,479
A tumor?
We don't know.

106
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:31,318
- We're checking just to be safe.
- Y'all already checked for that.

107
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:36,624
The previous M.R.I. had a broader view.
Some tumors are almost impossible to see
unless you know exactly where to look.

108
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:39,494
- That means it would be small, right?
- Yeah.

109
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:42,033
Then you'd be able
to operate, take it out?

110
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:45,036
If it's a tumor, there are
a variety of treatment options,

111
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:47,595
but there are variables
other than just size.

112
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,207
Don't worry.

113
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:54,212
Too late.

114
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:01,149
Try to remain as still as possible.

115
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:05,782
The less distortion there is,
the more detail we'll be able to see.
Okay.

116
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:18,735
X-ray tech, report to Radiology Room 3.

117
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:23,032
Well. That's what
breasts look like.

118
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,703
Is a lie a lie
if everybody knows it's a lie?

119
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:29,612
Well, if a tree pretends
to fall in a forest--
House, come on. They're breasts.

120
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:32,810
They're a birthday present,
not a philosophical treatise.
Lie number one.

121
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:35,820
She did not do that for her husband.
She did that for herself.

122
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:38,186
She thinks if she looks different,
she'll be different.

123
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:42,284
No. She thinks if she looks different,
she'll be more attractive,
which I have to say--

124
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:46,730
Not to her husband.
Cosmetic surgery is so everyone else
will look at us differently.

125
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,824
The same reason
you're wearing that tie.

126
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:51,495
Well, exactly.
That was gonna be my next point.

127
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:53,505
Last three months,
same five ties.

128
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,541
Thursday should be
that paisley thing.

129
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:58,270
It's a gift from my wife.
No, it's not.

130
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:00,778
Julie hates green.
You bought that yourself.

131
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:04,044
You want to look pretty at work.

132
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:05,913
Wilson's got a girlfriend.

133
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,509
D-- Stop.

134
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:09,748
Stop. I don't.

135
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:13,280
It takes two department heads
to treat shortness of breath?

136
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:17,386
What, do the complications
increase exponentially with cup size?

137
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:21,263
I want an E.K.G. and blood tests,
including tox screen on Mrs.--

138
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:26,268
- Exam Room One.
- You're ordering tests
to cover your lechery.

139
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,069
- Interesting.
- Very tricky case.

140
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,974
You love everybody.
That's your pathology.

141
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:39,512
There were no lesions
and no mass effect that we could see.

142
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,487
What does that mean?

143
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:47,219
It means we're still not sure
what's causing
the neurological problems.

144
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,727
I know some things are hard to cure,

145
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:53,731
but what I just don't get
is why it's taking so long
to figure out what's wrong with her.

146
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:56,768
- I know you're scared.
I would be too.
- I don't feel good.

147
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,732
You feeling nauseous?

148
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:02,273
Honey, are you all right?

149
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,937
She's seizing!

150
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,947
Get her on her side.

151
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:11,142
- I need some Ativan!
I'll get it.

152
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,914
- What's happened?
- She's having a seizure.

153
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:17,785
She's aspirating. Suction.

154
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:27,531
Come on, Elyse.

155
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,708
The M.R.I. reveals nothing.

156
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:49,254
That we were able to detect.
- It's not a tumor.

157
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:53,088
A small glioma
could hide from contrast.
We could do a PETscan.

158
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:56,856
Yes. That's how a responsible doctor
would waste his time in this situation.

159
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,591
Suddenly tests and radiologists
are incapable of error?

160
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:05,262
A glioma not presenting
on a contrast M.R.I. would have to be
smaller than a grain of sand,

161
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,499
which does not
a gravely ill person make.

162
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:11,441
- It could be just postictal disorientation.
- We would have seen
improvement by now.

163
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,741
- Late-stage Lyme disease
can cause seizures.
- Does the husband care about her?

164
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:17,146
- He hasn't left her bedside.
- How annoying.

165
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:19,207
It also means
she doesn't have Lyme disease.

166
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,412
What, love conquers all?

167
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:23,455
Lyme disease initially presents
with a rash.

168
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:26,013
- Mr. Clingy would have noticed.
- We've looked at everything else.

169
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,923
Did you look at her breasts?

170
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,256
Men.

171
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:31,796
It could be paraneoplastic.

172
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:35,527
She have any family history
of breast cancer?

173
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:37,899
Her mother died of it.

174
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,632
The brain, but not the brain.

175
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:42,765
Clever, huh?

176
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:52,082
How can breast cancer
cause problems in her brain?

177
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:56,451
There are molecular similarities
between brain cells and tumor cells.

178
00:10:56,522 --> 00:11:00,788
Paraneoplastic syndrome
causes the body's own antibodies
to get thrown off track.

179
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,727
They end up attacking the brain
instead of the tumor.

180
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:06,492
So, if you do find a tumor,
what do you do?

181
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:09,295
We treat the underlying malignancy.

182
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:13,134
Once there's no tumor to attack,
there's nothing for the antibodies
to get confused about.

183
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:15,969
- If the tumor's treatable.
- Exactly.

184
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:24,448
Ow.
I'm sorry.
I know it's uncomfortable.

185
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,782
The tighter we go,
the better the image will be.

186
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:34,257
At least it'll keep me awake.
Don't worry. It's almost over.

187
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:37,993
I wish people would stop
telling me not to worry.

188
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:40,931
I'm sorry.

189
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:46,468
My mom was the same age.

190
00:11:55,481 --> 00:12:00,043
We've been trying
to get pregnant for over a year.
Guess we're lucky we didn't.

191
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:02,383
A lot has changed
since your mom died.

192
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,389
Don't worr--

193
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,823
Don't give up.

194
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,238
No tumor?

195
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:23,639
The M.R.I. and the mammogram
only showed a few benign calcifications.

196
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:25,768
It's most likely a small-cell tumor.

197
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:28,040
It's no surprise
we're having trouble finding it.

198
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:31,982
We should do a PET scan.
Start with her lungs,
then maybe her bones.

199
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:34,246
Sometimes it presents
with no tumor at all.

200
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,087
- How can a disease caused by a tumor
present if there's no tumor?
- It happens-- 12% of cases.

201
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:42,025
- And how do you treat it
if there's no tumor?
- You don't.

202
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,619
Those 12%, no treatment.

203
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,722
They were too busy
looking for the tumor--

204
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,858
right till they put the patient
in the ground.

205
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,926
- What choice do we have?
- Treat the symptoms.

206
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:55,405
- I.V. immunoglobulin.
- So we're just gonna ignore the tumor?

207
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:58,932
Well, eventually it'll get bigger.
Then it'll be really easy to find.

208
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:02,503
- One of you needs to check out
where she works.
- Why?

209
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:05,106
- 'Cause the husband's not sick.
Meaning?

210
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:09,314
If it's not paraneoplastic,
and it is a reaction
to some sort of toxin,

211
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:11,856
it's obviously not
coming from their home.

212
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,355
Foreman, you do it.

213
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:22,198
Why are you riding me?
It's what I do.

214
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:24,896
Has it got worse lately?
Yeah. Seems to me.

215
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,904
Really?

216
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:30,772
Well, that rules out the race thing.
'Cause you were just as black last week.

217
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:34,312
How long has Elyse worked here?

218
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,780
Oh, three years.
She's my best rôtisseur.

219
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:41,377
And what's that?
The rôtisseur prepares
the roasted meats and gravies.

220
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:44,388
How do you clean your grill?

221
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:46,822
You say "elbow grease".
Do you use chemical cleaners?

222
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:50,055
Ah, non. Absolument.
And chefs don't do the cleaning anyway.

223
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:53,394
What about pesticides?
You must spray for roaches
and that sort of thing.

224
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:56,366
No. My kitchen is clean.
No roaches.

225
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:02,635
I need to get back to work.

226
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:06,075
So the fact that I'm here
asking you these questions,
it doesn't worry you?

227
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:08,909
Look at me.
I'm here 18 hours a day.

228
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:12,178
That guy practically lives here.
He does live here.

229
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:16,017
I use the same detergents
for 15 years, and everyone
is healthy as a horse.

230
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:19,251
Whatever Elyse has,
she didn't get here.

231
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:21,316
Tell her I hope
she feels better.

232
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:23,520
And I had to get a new rôtisseur.

233
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:39,573
- Where's Ed?
- He went down to the gift shop
to buy a shirt.

234
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:42,443
I told him I'd stay up here
in case you woke up.

235
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,851
You must have better things to do.

236
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,149
I send my laundry out.

237
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,781
- You're not married?
- No.

238
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:53,654
Waiting for the perfect guy?

239
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:58,228
Let me guess.
You've already found him.

240
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,828
He threw my towels out the window.

241
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:08,499
That's how we met.

242
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:13,876
Freshman year, Ed came to a party
that my roommate and I threw.

243
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:18,041
He spent most of the night
on the bathroom floor.

244
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:24,946
He figured I wouldn't notice
the vomit on the towels
if I didn't have any towels.

245
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,151
I'm assuming he came back
the next day to apologize?

246
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:32,595
No way.
I had to track him down.

247
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:39,469
Conflict resolution has never
been one of Ed's strong points.

248
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:42,597
Nobody's perfect, right?

249
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:45,337
I guess.

250
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,276
Oh, my neck hurts.

251
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:51,506
You've been in this bed
for a really long time.

252
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,087
We're gonna do the same test
we did last night, okay?
Do you know what day it is?

253
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:04,357
My arm itches.
It's probably a mild skin irritation.
I'll get you some hydrocortisone in a minute.

254
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,728
- Do you know what day it is?
- Tuesday.

255
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,994
It really itches.

256
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:11,366
How about I get you
that cream right now?

257
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:22,242
Oh, my God! Get them off!
Get 'em off of me!

258
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:25,044
- Get 'em off me! Get 'em off me!
- Elyse, calm down.

259
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:27,984
- Get them off me!
- Elyse, calm down. Calm down.

260
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:30,544
They're biting me!
Oh! They're biting me!

261
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:32,647
I'm gonna need some Haldol,
five milligrams.

262
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,955
- Honey, what's wrong?
- Get 'em off!

263
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,465
Get 'em off. Get 'em off.
There's nothing there, Elyse.

264
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:42,500
They're biting me.
There's nothing there.

265
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,502
Ow!

266
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:48,839
We had to sedate her.

267
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:52,070
You gave sedatives to a patient
who's already sleeping
18 hours a day?

268
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:54,942
It was better than letting her
scratch all the skin off her arms.

269
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,711
- Where's Wilson?
- Creepy-crawlies are consistent
with paraneoplastic syndrome.

270
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:01,082
Onset immediately after
I.V.I.G. isn't.

271
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:03,383
There is a simple explanation.

272
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:05,446
Maybe she really has
bugs under her skin.

273
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:10,120
- Infection?
- That's what a worsening of symptoms
after immunotherapy would suggest.

274
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:13,130
Blood cultures and the timeline
rule out most bacteria.

275
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:16,656
Patient throws up on your shoes,
do you clean up most of it?

276
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:19,966
The symptoms rule out the rest.
Serology rules out viruses.

277
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,007
C.S.F. smears rule out parasites.

278
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:25,271
In the final stage
of African trypanosomiasis...

279
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,744
almost all the parasites
are inside the brain.

280
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:29,906
It's possible
they wouldn't show on smears.

281
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:34,476
But it's not possible for a patient
who's never been to Africa
to have African sleeping sickness.

282
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,647
- I'm just saying it fits the symptoms.
- She could've got it from a transfusion.

283
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:42,319
- Or I'm just saying she could've
got it from a transfusion.
- Which she never had.

284
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,986
Okay.
What about toxins?

285
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,590
No, the kitchen she works in
is cleaner than some hospitals.

286
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,032
But they do serve rabbit.

287
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:52,764
Rabbit fever fits her symptoms.

288
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:55,864
Tularemia initially presents
with a rash or ulcer near the infection site.

289
00:17:55,941 --> 00:18:00,378
Not if she inhaled it.
Chopping the meat with the cleaver
could easily aerosolize the bacteria.

290
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:04,815
- No. Then she'd have respiratory symptoms.
- Maybe she ignored it,
figured she had a cold.

291
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:07,977
We rejected Lyme disease because
the couple would have noticed a rash,

292
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:10,317
but a wet, hacking cough
is just gonna slip right by?

293
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:15,622
It's either that or she missed her exit
on the turnpike and wound up in Africa.

294
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:17,958
Okay, two lousy ideas.

295
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,555
Unfortunately, they're better
than all the other ideas.

296
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:24,124
Tularemia. Bizarre.

297
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:28,799
Very nice.
That's why I ride you.

298
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:40,584
Stay tuned--
Did he just turn on the TV?

299
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:42,711
He needs to think.

300
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:46,280
So this should tell us
whether or not she's got rabbit fever?

301
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:49,885
For a diagnosis of tularemia
you need a fourfold increase
in serum antibody levels.

302
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,760
To measure an increase you need a before.
All we have is an after.

303
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:56,392
- A single titer over 160
would be a big clue.
- "That's why I ride you".

304
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,834
What does that mean?
When I have a good idea
it's because of him?

305
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:02,032
Actually, I think he said
your idea was a lousy idea.

306
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:06,009
It has to be one of these two conditions.
I say we take our best guess
and start treatment. Or treat both.

307
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:08,546
The treatment for tularemia
can cause aplastic anemia.

308
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:11,242
- How come he doesn't ride you guys?
- Got a crush on you.

309
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:14,877
- He just doesn't know how to show it.
- Get over it. He rides everybody.

310
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:18,684
- The treatment for sleeping sickness
kills one in 10 patients.
- We start with the safer treatment.

311
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:22,318
By "safer", you mean the one
that's slightly less likely to kill her.

312
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:38,803
Foreman got the gang
testing for tularemia?

313
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:42,608
- Yep.
- Probably inconclusive, but worth doing.

314
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,479
So, what's her name?
When do I get to meet her?

315
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:48,247
- There's nobody.
Give it up.
- Your lips say no.

316
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,880
Your shoes say yes.
Well, they're French.

317
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:54,687
- You can't trust a word they say.
- Solid, yet stylish.

318
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,024
A professional woman
would be impressed.

319
00:19:57,095 --> 00:20:00,121
I'm thinking accountant.
Actuary maybe.

320
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,394
It's somebody in the hospital.

321
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:04,401
Patient?

322
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:07,495
No. Chemo's not sexy.
Daughter of a patient.

323
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:09,598
She would certainly have
the neediness you need.

324
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:11,768
I'm not gonna date
a patient's daughter.

325
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:15,939
Very ethical.
Ofcourse, most married men
would say they don't date at all.

326
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:18,312
There was no date.

327
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,977
I had lunch with one of the nurses.

328
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:24,682
It's her first time in an oncology unit.
She's having a tough time-- emotionally.

329
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:27,122
- Perfect.
- I wanted to be nice.

330
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:29,626
That's all.
I mean it.

331
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:32,027
You always do.
It's part of your charm.

332
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:33,962
Hi, boys.

333
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:36,500
Mrs. Campbell's test results.

334
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,435
You remember her.
The preschool teacher
with the heart of silicone.

335
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:41,131
No. Doesn't ring a bell.

336
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:45,643
They came in yesterday. I figured you guys
would have been all over them.
I know how concerned you were.

337
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:49,306
She's all upset 'cause we paid
more attention to the other girl.

338
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:51,872
You check out her ass.
I've got the chest.

339
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:54,942
The tests were normal.
Ofcourse, that's just my opinion.

340
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,183
You might wanna call a couple of guys
from maintenance in for a consult.

341
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,124
You check her E.K.G. results
before she left the other day?

342
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:03,388
- You ordered it.
- You're the responsible one.

343
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:06,659
- What's wrong?
They look normal to me.
- Where is she?

344
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:09,701
- Waiting downstairs. Why?
- I was right.

345
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:20,075
Do I have to get rid of the implants?

346
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:22,409
Surprisingly, no.

347
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:25,678
But your E.K.G. shows
a slightly decreased heart rate.

348
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:29,312
Is that a problem?
You told me you hadn't changed
your diet or exercise. Were you lying?

349
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:33,324
Lying?
Does your husband have
high blood pressure?

350
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:35,326
My husband?
Yeah, you see,

351
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:38,659
if you're gonna repeat
everything I say, this conversation's
gonna take twice as long.

352
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,597
Yes. He was diagnosed
six months ago.

353
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:44,727
He do a lot of cooking?
Not really, other than oatmeal
in the morning.

354
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:48,705
Did you happen to notice
a slightly odd taste
to the oatmeal lately?

355
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:51,242
Wait. Are you saying that--
That it looks like your husband...

356
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,370
stirred in some of
his blood pressure medication
along with the brown sugar.

357
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:59,349
You think my husband's
trying to poison me?
No. Nothing like that.

358
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:02,581
He just doesn't
want to have sex with you.

359
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:06,750
Decreased sex drive is one of
the most common side effects
of the beta-blockers he's been taking.

360
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:10,420
I'm guessing he figured
if you're both frigid, no harm, no foul.

361
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:13,623
Should've gotten him the sweater.
That's ridiculous.

362
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:19,501
Fine. But if you're still concerned
about the shortness of breath,
I'd start making your own breakfast.

363
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:21,732
Wait.

364
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:24,002
What should I do?

365
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:29,604
If you care about your husband at all,
I'd do the responsible thing.

366
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:32,616
Buy yourself some condoms,
go to a bar, find--

367
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,224
Huh.

368
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:53,304
Lab tests inconclusive?

369
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:56,136
Not surprisingly.
No. But too bad.

370
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,302
Luckily, I have the answer.

371
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,642
- To what?
- Thanks for asking.

372
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:06,480
To life itself: sex. Anything that can be
transmitted via the blood
can be transmitted through sex.

373
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:09,281
- Sleeping sickness from sex?
- It's not without precedent.

374
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:13,814
I'm pretty sure it is, unless you're
talking about going to Africa
and having sex with a tsetse fly.

375
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:18,420
A Portuguese man
was diagnosed three years ago
with C.N.S.-affected sleeping sickness.

376
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:22,661
His only connection with Africa
was through a girlfriend
who'd served with the military in Angola.

377
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,702
Boy. Where'd you find that?

378
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:28,297
The Journal of the Instituto
de Higiene e Medicina Tropical.

379
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:30,341
- You don't read Portuguese?
- You do?

380
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:34,277
Pretty sure that's what it said.
Either that or it was
an ad for sunglasses.

381
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:36,371
Her husband has never
been to Africa either.

382
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:39,781
Oh, stymied again.
Your logic is bulletproof.

383
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:43,116
I think ignoring respiratory symptoms
is more likely than cheating.

384
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:47,090
Because?
They're completely
devoted to each other.

385
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:49,787
Because?
They love each other.

386
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:51,795
Or?

387
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:54,354
They're overcompensating for guilt.

388
00:23:55,734 --> 00:24:01,195
- Find out which it is.
- You want me to ask a man whose wife
is about to die if he cheated on her?

389
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,470
No, I want you to be polite
and let her die.

390
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:08,707
Actually, I don't want you
to ask her anything. Foreman,
take the husband. Chase, take the wife.

391
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:21,420
You don't trust me to do my job?

392
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:24,462
We all formulate questions based on
the answers we want to hear.

393
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:27,157
And how exactly do you reformulate
"Have you screwed around?"

394
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:29,564
Did you know she's been
trying to get pregnant?
Yes.

395
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:33,536
After you got so freaked
about the sick babies a while ago,
Ifigured that was your thing.

396
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:37,598
But you've never been prescribed
folic acid, and you can't lose a baby
if you've never been pregnant.

397
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:41,544
You pulled my medical records?
You coughed the other day.
I was concerned.

398
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:47,415
You were curious, like an eight-year-old boy
with a puzzle that's just a little too
grown-up for him to figure out.

399
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:50,578
Tomayto, tomahto.

400
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:56,093
So it's either, uh, sleeping sickness
or this rabbit thing?

401
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,152
They're both fatal without treatment.

402
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:01,757
And unfortunately, the treatment
for both is extremely dangerous.

403
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,768
Are there tests you can do?
Not at this stage.

404
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:07,566
But each condition has a unique history.

405
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:11,633
We're hoping your answers
to a few questions will help us.

406
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:14,975
Sure. Whatever you need to know.

407
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:18,607
Before the sleeping problems,
did you have any trouble breathing,

408
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:21,709
a cough that wouldn't go away--
anything like that?

409
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:25,045
No.

410
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:27,455
Are you certain?
Absolutely.

411
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:30,120
I've never been away from her
for more than a night.

412
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,595
If she had breathing troubles
I would've noticed.

413
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:38,394
The other condition is
significantly more likely if--

414
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:42,264
if you've had an affair.

415
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:45,002
Have you ever had an affair?

416
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:47,101
Ofcourse not.

417
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:51,080
- Are you sure?
- I think I'd remember
cheating on my wife.

418
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:53,174
You might be
reluctant to admit it.
No.

419
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:55,412
I just want to be perfectly clear.

420
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:59,082
If your wife has sleeping sickness,
and we don't treat her,

421
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:02,025
she'll die.

422
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:05,426
I would never do that to Ed.

423
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:08,864
I love him.
Absolutely not.

424
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:10,925
I love her.

425
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:16,864
All right.

426
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:29,619
All right then.
They say no cheating,
we cross off sleeping sickness.

427
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:31,815
Any new ideas?

428
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:35,184
Okay. We go with Foreman's tularemia.

429
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:39,390
Start her on I.V. chloramphenicol,
25 milligrams per kilogram,
four times a day.

430
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:41,455
Good night.

431
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:57,574
Where's Ed?
Right next to you.

432
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:59,810
Well, you're two down,
two to go.

433
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,854
Two days?

434
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:07,688
No. Doses. You have about
20 more days of this fun.

435
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:10,421
What time is it?

436
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:14,329
About 4:00 a.m.
I pulled the short straw.

437
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:19,560
Flow rate looks good.

438
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:26,433
No rash or flushing.

439
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:30,073
What time is it?

440
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:33,976
4:00 a.m.

441
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:36,452
Do you not remember just asking?

442
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:40,714
I don't--

443
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:43,056
Elyse?

444
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:47,864
Elyse? Elyse?

445
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:50,765
- Elyse.
- What are you doing?

446
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,860
- I'm trying to wake her.
- She fall asleep again?

447
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:55,201
In the middle of a sentence.
Elyse. Elyse.

448
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:58,834
What's happening?
- Patient's not responding.

449
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,174
Pulse is fine.
Airway's open.

450
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:03,237
Check her blood pressure.

451
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:07,113
Pupils are reactive.

452
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,779
Elyse, wake up.
You gotta wake up.

453
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:13,654
- What does that mean?
What are you doing?
- She's unresponsive to pain.

454
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:16,626
Come on, Elyse.

455
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:19,926
- Is she dying?
- I don't know.

456
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,240
She's in a coma.

457
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:42,244
There's only one way
a tularemia patient
goes into a coma...

458
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,254
while on I.V. chloramphenicol.

459
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:47,655
The patient doesn't have tularemia.
And then there was one.

460
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,751
Patient comes in
'cause she's sleeping too much.

461
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:53,992
It takes 10 doctors and a coma
to diagnose sleeping sickness.
And then there was none.

462
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:57,125
We still have the problem
of explaining how
a white chick from Jersey...

463
00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:59,727
who's never traveled south of D.C.
has African sleeping sickness.

464
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:02,034
Still have the obvious explanation.

465
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:08,138
I made it clear.
If this guy's lying about sleeping around
he knows he's murdering his wife.

466
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:10,374
Does seem unlikely.

467
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:12,439
Go away.

468
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:32,100
What are you doing?

469
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:35,704
Checking for lymphadenopathy.

470
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:39,403
And waiting for you.
Who are you?

471
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:41,570
I'm Dr. House.

472
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:44,615
Your wife has
human African trypanosomiasis.

473
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:49,450
Sleeping sickness.
You mean it's not tularemia,

474
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:52,081
a virus, tumor or-- or cancer?

475
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:55,024
No.

476
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:58,855
I've never had an affair.

477
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,023
I believe you.

478
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:03,693
And I trust Elyse.

479
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:09,236
The treatment for this disease
is a drug that's...

480
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:12,299
fatal on its own 10% of the time.

481
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:16,438
Which is why I need
your written consent
before I can legally prescribe it.

482
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:20,075
Why would she lie
if she knew it could kill her?
I don't ask why patients lie.

483
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,085
I just assume they all do.

484
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,747
But why?
To protect you,

485
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,883
because she didn't think it mattered,
it just seemed easier, because...

486
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:31,418
that's what people do.

487
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:37,826
If you're absolutely certain
that your wife has never
had sex with anyone but you...

488
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:40,427
since you were married,
then I'm wrong.

489
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:46,701
But if you think there's
a possibility that just one time...

490
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:50,674
she wasn't perfect--

491
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:52,909
one weekend you're out of town,

492
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:56,113
one fight where she ran to a friend,

493
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:58,246
one stupid Christmas party--

494
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:04,053
then you need to allow me
to start treatment.

495
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:07,724
Because if we don't,

496
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,767
she's gonna be dead
by tomorrow morning.

497
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:21,338
You trust your wife that much?

498
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:25,606
I don't know.

499
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,314
I'm gonna start the treatment.

500
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:51,264
Glass syringes?
And special I.V. tubing.

501
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:54,368
Why do we need this stuff?
Because melarsoprol melts plastic.

502
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:56,970
This stuff's basically arsenic
mixed with antifreeze.

503
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:00,141
What doesn't kill us
makes us stronger, huh?

504
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:03,187
Nietzsche wouldn't have been so glib
if he'd been prescribed melarsoprol.

505
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:08,019
"Can cause vomiting, abdominal pain,

506
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,856
blood toxicity, neural damage,
cardiac arrhythmia".

507
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,523
They forgot to say
it's gonna hurt like all hell.

508
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:16,158
She's lucky she's in a coma.

509
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:36,553
How long before we know
if it's working?
It's tough to say.

510
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,419
It's a good sign
that she hasn't gotten any worse.

511
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:44,454
Does she even know I'm here?

512
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:47,191
She knows you're
always there for her.

513
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:52,229
Yeah.

514
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,533
If she gets better,

515
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:56,630
it means she wasn't always there for me.

516
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:02,803
It means she made a mistake.

517
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,306
I can't help it.

518
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:10,912
Part of me-- a big part of me--
can't handle that.

519
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:15,249
It doesn't want her to get better.

520
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:27,060
Does that make me
a terrible person?

521
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,771
Yes.

522
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:01,999
So you're treating her
for African sleeping sickness...

523
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:05,531
because you don't think it's possible
for someone to be faithful
in a relationship?

524
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,578
And you do?
Yes.

525
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:11,843
And you need to tell me that.
Look. I am not having an affair.

526
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:15,374
I had lunch with someone
I work with-- at work. Once.

527
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:19,048
I believe you.
What I don't believe
is it'll be just once.

528
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:21,614
I love my wife.
You certainly love saying it.

529
00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:25,355
I'm sorry.
I know you love your wife.

530
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,489
You loved all your wives.
Probably still do.

531
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:30,932
In fact, you probably love
all the women you loved
who weren't your wife.

532
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:34,460
You can be a real jerk sometimes,
you know that?
Yeah. And you're the good guy.

533
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:38,134
At least I try.
As long as you're trying to be good,
you can do whatever you want.

534
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:42,543
And as long as you're not trying,
you can say whatever you want.
So, between us, we can do anything.

535
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:45,138
We can rule the world.

536
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:59,623
Mixing up some margaritas?

537
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:01,858
Mine's a double, senorita.

538
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,197
That's Portuguese, you know.
Spanish.

539
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,203
Uh-oh.

540
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:10,373
What's goin' on?

541
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:13,205
I'm recalibrating the centrifuge.

542
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:15,268
Turn around.

543
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:26,648
It's a very sad thing.

544
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:28,692
An uncalibrated centrifuge.

545
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:32,593
Makes me cry too.
I'm not crying.

546
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:35,755
Okay.

547
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:51,673
I told the husband he was a jerk.

548
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:55,542
Why?

549
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:03,956
When I was in college, I--

550
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:11,393
I fell in love,
and I got married.

551
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:13,630
And--

552
00:36:13,704 --> 00:36:15,797
At that age, the chances
of marriage lasting--

553
00:36:15,873 --> 00:36:18,273
It lasted six months.

554
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:23,574
Thyroid cancer
metastasized to his brain.

555
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:25,741
There was nothing they could do.

556
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,786
I was 21, and...

557
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:33,156
I watched my husband die.

558
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:38,795
I'm sorry.

559
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:44,958
But that's not the whole story.

560
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:50,000
It's a symptom, not your illness.

561
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:53,737
Thyroid cancer would have been
diagnosed at least a year before his death.

562
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:56,302
You knew he was dying
when you married him.

563
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,178
It must have been
when you first met him.

564
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:05,522
And you married him anyway.

565
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:11,127
You can't be that good a person
and well-adjusted.

566
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:15,026
Why?

567
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:18,091
'Cause you wind up
crying over centrifuges.

568
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:23,634
Or hating people?

569
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:40,557
Her fever spiked at 104.

570
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:42,559
Echo shows global hyperkinesis.

571
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:44,618
Blood pressure?
Barely 90 over 40.

572
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:48,597
Did you give her dopamine?
Started 270 micrograms
per minute 10 minutes ago.

573
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,964
Still no change.

574
00:37:56,474 --> 00:38:00,570
Killing the parasites
isn't gonna do much good
if we kill her heart at the same time.

575
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:03,045
A heart can be replaced.
A brain can't.

576
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,412
Right now we're killing both.

577
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:10,386
If she's gonna die, we should at least
let her do it without that acid
flowing through her veins.

578
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,945
What's happening?

579
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:18,753
We would've expected
your wife's condition to show
some improvement by now.

580
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:20,763
It hasn't.

581
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:22,822
It's going the other way.

582
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:55,955
Please don't die.

583
00:38:57,868 --> 00:38:59,859
Please don't die.

584
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:26,826
She's awake.

585
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:10,773
Hey. She's gonna be okay.

586
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:13,639
Yeah. Sure.

587
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:44,405
What are you gonna do?

588
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:47,000
Were you always honest with her?

589
00:40:47,077 --> 00:40:50,843
Do you know how lucky you are?
Your wife is alive. She loves you.

590
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:53,884
What she did--

591
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:56,852
You can't love a person
and do that to them.

592
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:02,082
She loves you.

593
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:41,358
I need to know
who you had the affair with.

594
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:47,835
He has to be notified
so he can get treatment as well.

595
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:54,508
Why did you lie to us?

596
00:41:54,578 --> 00:41:57,069
You knew your life was at stake.

597
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:05,887
He's not coming back, is he?

598
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,924
We all make mistakes,

599
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:14,965
and we all pay a price.

600
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:26,039
I need that name.

601
00:42:39,823 --> 00:42:42,018
Hey, there.
How you doin'?

602
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:44,026
Fine.

603
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:47,864
Do you know where your dad is?

604
00:42:57,341 --> 00:42:59,332
Can I help you?
