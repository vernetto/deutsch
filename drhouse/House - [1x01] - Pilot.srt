1
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:48,213
Why are you late?
You're not going to
like the answer.

2
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:50,647
I already know the answer.
I missed the bus.

3
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,652
I don't doubt it.
No bus stops near Brad's.

4
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,154
You spent the night,
the alarm didn't work--
or maybe it did.

5
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,656
I didn't sleep with him.
Girl, either there's something--

6
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,659
I missed the bus!

7
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,662
There's something
either very wrong with you
or something very wrong with him.

8
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,665
There's nothing wrong with him.
Please tell me
you know that for a fact.

9
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,667
Melanie, I gotta go.
You're lying, aren't you?

10
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:12,068
I wouldn't lie to you.
Good morning, guys!

11
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:14,072
Good morning, Miss Rebecca!

12
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,904
Everybody's in their seats?
Yes.

13
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:22,940
Okay. Sydney, why don't you tell us
what you did this weekend?

14
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:24,950
She look--

15
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:27,282
Come on, Sydney.
We know you're not shy.

16
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:31,619
How come we always
have to tell you what we did,
and you never tell us what you did?

17
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:35,593
Okay.

18
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:37,755
I had a really great weekend.

19
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:40,857
- But you can't tell
Miss Melanie, okay?
- What did you do?

20
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,459
I made a new friend.

21
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:46,471
It's so much fun
to make new friends, isn't it?

22
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:48,006
Yeah.
Yeah.

23
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:50,770
Did you tell your mom and dad
about your new friend?

24
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:54,012
Absolutely.

25
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,106
You should never keep anything
from your parents.

26
00:01:57,183 --> 00:02:00,311
And I told mine--

27
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:03,818
Wha--

28
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:13,063
Ca-- Ba--

29
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:21,469
Ha-- Ba-- Cra--

30
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:30,549
C-- A-- L--

31
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:33,976
H-- E-- "The!"

32
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:35,918
We know that word.
"The."

33
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:03,982
Twenty-nine-year old female.
First seizure one month ago.

34
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,349
Lost the ability to speak.
Babbled like a baby.

35
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,752
Progressive deterioration
of mental status.

36
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:12,757
You see that?
They all assume I'm a patient
because of this cane.

37
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:16,761
So put on a white coat
like the rest of us.
I don't want them to think I'm a doctor.

38
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:19,764
You see where the administration
might have a problem
with that attitude?

39
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:21,766
People don't want a sick doctor.

40
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:24,769
That's fair enough.
I don't like healthy patients.

41
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:28,432
The 29-year old female--
The one who can't talk?
I like that part.

42
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:31,102
She's my cousin.

43
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:33,611
And your cousin
doesn't like the diagnosis.

44
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,614
I wouldn't either.

45
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:38,173
Brain tumor.
She's going to die. Boring.

46
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:42,521
No wonder you're such
a renowned diagnostician.

47
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:45,183
You don't need to actually know anything
to figure out what's wrong.

48
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:48,193
You're the oncologist.
I'm just a lowly infectious disease guy.

49
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:50,195
Yes.
Just a simple country doctor.

50
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:52,697
Brain tumors at her age
are highly unlikely.

51
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:54,960
She's 29.
Whatever she's got
is highly unlikely.

52
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:57,969
The protein markers for the three most
prevalent brain cancers came up negative.

53
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:02,633
That's an H.M.O. lab. Might as well have sent it
to a high school kid with a chemistry set.

54
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,643
No family history.

55
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,645
I thought your uncle
died of cancer.

56
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:09,011
Other side.
No environmental factors.
That you know of.

57
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,448
And she's not responding
to radiation treatment.

58
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:13,985
None of which is even close
to dispositive.

59
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:18,854
All it does is raise one question:
Your cousin goes to an H.M.O.?

60
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:22,122
Come on. Why leave all the fun
for the coroner?

61
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:25,460
What's the point of putting together a team
if you're not gonna use them?

62
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:31,299
You've got three overqualified doctors
working for you, getting bored.

63
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,033
It's a lesion.

64
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:40,061
And the big green thing in the middle
of the bigger blue thing on a map...

65
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,164
is an island.

66
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:44,209
I was hoping for something
a bit more creative.

67
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:47,940
Shouldn't we be speaking to the patient
before we start diagnosing?

68
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,914
- Is she a doctor?
- No, but--

69
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:52,246
- Everybody lies.
- Dr. House doesn't like
dealing with patients.

70
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:55,253
Isn't treating patients
why we became doctors?

71
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:58,256
No. Treating illnesses
is why we became doctors.

72
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:01,589
Treating patients
is what makes most doctors miserable.

73
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:04,926
So you're trying to eliminate the humanity
from the practice of medicine?

74
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:08,558
If we don't talk to them,
they can't lie to us,
and we can't lie to them.

75
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:11,262
Humanity's overrated.

76
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:15,330
- I don't think it's a tumor.
- First year medical school-- if you hear
hoof beats, you think horses, not zebras.

77
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,239
Are you in
first year medical school?

78
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:22,340
No. First of all,
there's nothing on the CAT scan.

79
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,349
Second of all, if this is a horse,

80
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:27,978
then her kindly family doctor in Trenton
makes the obvious diagnosis,
and it never gets near this office.

81
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,648
Differential diagnosis, people.

82
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:34,625
If it's not a tumor,
what are the suspects?
Why couldn't she talk?

83
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:38,095
Aneurysm, stroke
or some other ischemic syndrome.

84
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:40,655
- Get her a contrast M.R.I.
- Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease?

85
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,394
- Mad cow?
- Mad zebra.

86
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:44,163
Wernicke's encephalopathy.

87
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:47,104
No. Blood thiamine level was normal.

88
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,471
The lab in Trenton
could have screwed up the blood tests.

89
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:53,171
I assume it's a corollary if "people lie"
that "people screw up".

90
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:58,548
Redraw the blood tests and get her
scheduled for that contrast M.R.I. ASAP.

91
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,950
Let's find out what kind of zebra
we're treating here.

92
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:15,032
Radiology, please call the page.

93
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,296
Radiology, please call the page.

94
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:25,837
I was expecting you in my office
20 minutes ago.

95
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:29,211
Really? Well, that's odd
because I had no intention of
being in your office 20 minutes ago.

96
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,774
You think we have nothing to talk about?
No. I just can't think of anything
I'd be interested in.

97
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:35,286
I sign your paychecks.
I have tenure.

98
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:41,286
Are you gonna grab my cane now,
stop me from leaving?
That would be juvenile.

99
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:49,724
I can still fire you
if you're not doing your job.
I'm here from 9:00 to 5:00.

100
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,635
Your billings
are practically nonexistent.
Rough year.

101
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:55,640
You ignore requests for consults.
I call back.
Sometimes I misdial.

102
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,643
You're six years behind
on your obligations to the clinic.

103
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:01,646
See? I was right.
This doesn't interest me.

104
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:04,649
Six years times three weeks--
you owe me better than four months.

105
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:07,208
It's 5:00.
I'm going home.

106
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:09,220
To what?

107
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:11,279
Nice.

108
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,895
Look, Dr. House, the only reason
why I don't fire you...

109
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,898
is because your reputation
is still worth something
to this hospital.

110
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:23,197
Excellent. We have a point of agreement--
you're not gonna fire me.

111
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:26,204
Your reputation won't last
if you don't do your job.

112
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:29,435
The clinic is part of your job.
I want you to do your job.

113
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:33,775
But, as the philosopher Jagger once said,
"You can't always get what you want".

114
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:44,022
You're not my doctor.
Are you Dr. House?

115
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,217
Thankfully, no.
I'm Dr. Chase.

116
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,226
Dr. House
is the head of diagnostic medicine.

117
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:52,594
He's very busy, but he has taken
a keen interest in your case.

118
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,564
We inject gadolinium into a vein.

119
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:04,201
It distributes itself throughout your brain
and acts as a contrast material
for the magnetic resonance imager.

120
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,313
Basically, whatever's in your head
lights up like a Christmas tree.

121
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,179
- It might make you feel
a little light-headed.
- Dr. Cameron.

122
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,845
I'm sorry. I have to stop you.
There is a problem.

123
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:17,446
You pulled my authorization!

124
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:19,582
Yes.
Why are you yelling?

125
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,650
No M.R.I.'s, no imaging studies,
no labs.

126
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,753
You also can't make
long distance phone calls.

127
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:28,425
- If you're going to fire me,
have the guts to face me.
- Or photocopies. You're still yelling.

128
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:31,368
I'm angry!
You're risking a patient's life.

129
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:34,270
- I assume those are two separate points.
- You showed me disrespect.

130
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,604
You embarrassed me.
And as long as I work here,
you have no legal--

131
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,610
Is the yelling
designed to scare me?

132
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:43,115
Because I'm not sure what it is
I'm supposed to be scared of.
More yelling?

133
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:45,116
That's not scary.

134
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:48,483
That you're going to hurt me? That's scary.
But I'm pretty sure I can outrun you.

135
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:53,492
Oh, I looked into that philosopher
you quoted-- Jagger.

136
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:56,392
And you're right,
you can't always get what you want.

137
00:09:56,462 --> 00:10:00,364
But as it turns out,
"If you try sometimes,
you get what you need".

138
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:04,403
So, because you want me
to treat patients,

139
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,496
you're not letting me treat patients?

140
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:09,404
I need you to do your job.

141
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:21,517
Do the M.R.I.
She folded.

142
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:29,618
I've got to do four hours a week
in this clinic until I make up
the time I've missed.

143
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:34,862
2054.
I'll be caught up in 2054.

144
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:38,768
You better love this cousin
a whole lot.

145
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:15,835
All right, Rebecca,
I know you may feel
a little claustrophobic in there,

146
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:18,138
but we need you to remain still.

147
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:22,342
Okay, we're going to begin.

148
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,121
I don't feel so good.

149
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,787
It's all right.
Just try to relax.

150
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:46,460
Rebecca?

151
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:49,564
Rebecca?

152
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:01,285
Rebecca?

153
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:03,753
Get her out of there.
Oh, she probably fell asleep.

154
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:06,155
She's exhausted.
She was claustrophobic
30 seconds ago.

155
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:09,160
- She's not sleeping.
We gotta get her out of there.
- It'll just be another minute.

156
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:12,425
If she's having an allergic reaction
to the gadolinium,
she'll be dead in two minutes.

157
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:17,028
Hold her neck.
All right.

158
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:19,333
Oh, she's ashen.

159
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,373
She's not breathing.
Epi, .5.

160
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,772
Come on.

161
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:25,777
I can't ventilate.

162
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:32,308
- Too much edema.
Where's the surgical airway kit?
- Yep. Coming.

163
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:10,054
Good call.

164
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:33,609
We'll get that tube out
of your throat later today.

165
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:36,375
Just get some rest for now, okay?

166
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:41,779
Told you.
You can't trust people.

167
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:43,788
She probably knew
she was allergic to gadolinium.

168
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:46,984
Figured it was an easy way
to get someone to cut a hole in her throat.

169
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:49,926
Can't get a picture.
Gonna have to get a thousand words.

170
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:53,522
You actually want me to talk to
the patient, get a history?

171
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:57,933
We need to know if there's
some genetic or environmental cause
that's triggering an inflammatory response.

172
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,937
I thought everybody lied.

173
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:03,202
Truth begins in lies.

174
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:05,266
Think about it.

175
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:08,774
That doesn't mean anything,
does it?

176
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:16,121
12:52 p.m. Dr. House checks in.
Please write that down.

177
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,122
Do you have cable TV
here somewhere?

178
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,124
General Hospital
starts in eight minutes.

179
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,126
No TV, but we've got patients.

180
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,628
Can't you give out
the aspirin yourself?
I'll do paperwork.

181
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,632
I made sure your first case
was an interesting one.
Cough just won't go away?

182
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,635
Runny nose looks a funny color?
Patient admitted
complaining of back spasms.

183
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:34,833
Oh? I think I read about something like that
in the New England Journal of Medicine.
Patient is orange.

184
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:37,137
The color?
No, the fruit.

185
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,643
You mean yellow.
It's jaundice.
I mean orange.

186
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,907
Well, how orange?
It's probably--
Exam room one.

187
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:44,142
Dr. Kahn, you're needed in pediatrics.

188
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:50,218
I was playing golf
and my cleats got stuck.
It hurt a little, but I kept playing.

189
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:53,417
The next morning,
I could barely stand up.

190
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:56,689
Well, you're smiling,
so I take it that means this isn't serious.

191
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,923
What's that?
What are you doing?

192
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:01,899
Painkillers.

193
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:04,868
Oh, for you.
For your leg.
No, 'cause they're yummy.

194
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:08,065
You want one?
Make your back feel better.

195
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:12,543
Unfortunately,
you have a deeper problem.

196
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:14,909
Your wife is having an affair.

197
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,040
- What?
- You're orange, you moron.

198
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:20,347
It's one thing for you not to notice,

199
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:24,583
but if your wife hasn't picked up on the fact
that her husband has changed colors,
she's just not paying attention.

200
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:28,491
By the way, do you consume
just a ridiculous amount of carrots
and megadose vitamins?

201
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,087
Carrots turn you yellow,
the niacin turns you red.
Find some finger paint and do the math.

202
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:34,098
And get a good lawyer.

203
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:41,138
Deep breath.

204
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:43,731
It's cold.

205
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:45,902
He's been using his inhaler?

206
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:48,913
Not in the past few days.
He's, um, only 10.

207
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:51,745
I worry about children taking
such strong medicine so frequently.

208
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:54,718
What happened to your leg?

209
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,779
Your doctor probably
was concerned about
the strength of the medicine too.

210
00:15:57,856 --> 00:16:01,155
She probably weighed that danger
against the danger of not breathing.

211
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:05,788
Oxygen is so important
during those prepubescent years.
Don't you think?

212
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:08,799
Okay, I'm gonna assume nobody
has ever told you what asthma is.

213
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:11,233
Or if they have,
you had other things on your mind.

214
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:14,830
A stimulant triggers cells
in your child's airways...

215
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:18,468
to release substances
that inflame the air passages
and cause them to contract.

216
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:21,911
Mucus production increases,
the cell lining starts to shed.

217
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,506
But the steroids--

218
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:28,246
the steroids stop the inflammation.

219
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:31,648
The more often this happens--

220
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:34,352
What?
The more often this happens, what?

221
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:38,419
Forget it. If you don't trust steroids,
you shouldn't trust doctors.

222
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:41,694
My mother passed away
four years ago.

223
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:47,034
She had a heart attack,
and my father broke his back
doing construction--

224
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:52,433
It's House. It's urgent.
I'm sorry.

225
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,578
You couldn't have knocked?

226
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:02,677
Steroids. Give her steroids.
High doses of prednisone.

227
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:14,799
You're looking for support
for a diagnosis of cerebral vasculitis?

228
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,631
Inflammation of blood vessels
in the brain is awfully rare,
especially for someone her age.

229
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,604
- So is a tumor.
Her sed rate is elevated.
- Mildly.

230
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:23,072
That could mean anything.
Or nothing.

231
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:26,077
Yeah, I know.
I have no reason
to think that it's vasculitis.

232
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:28,079
Except that it could be.

233
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:31,583
If the blood vessels are inflamed,
that's gonna look exactly like what we saw
on the M.R.I. from Trenton County,

234
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,982
and the pressure
is gonna cause neurological symptoms.

235
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,920
- We can't diagnose that without a biopsy.
- Yes, we can.

236
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:39,253
We treat her.
If she gets better,
we know we're right.

237
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:42,691
- And if we're wrong?
- Then we learn something else.

238
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:49,194
Why steroids?

239
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:51,202
Just part of your treatment.

240
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,067
You haven't had many visitors.

241
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:55,231
No boyfriend?
Three dates.

242
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:58,606
I wouldn't have stood by him
if he were vomiting all day.

243
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:01,009
What about work?
You must have friends from work.

244
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,880
Pretty much everybody I like
is five years old.

245
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,619
The nurse said
you're stopping my radiation.

246
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:13,116
We're just trying
some alternative medication.

247
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:16,559
So where's your family from then?
Steroids aren't
an alternative to radiation.

248
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:18,823
The tests
weren't really conclusive.

249
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:20,831
We're treating you for vasculitis.

250
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:23,891
It's the inflammation
of blood vessels in the brain.

251
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:26,904
I-It's not a tumor?

252
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:28,963
I don't have a tumor?

253
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:35,736
You should have told her the truth--
It's a long shot guess.

254
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:38,248
Thank you.
If House is right, no harm.

255
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:40,683
If he's wrong,
I've given a dying woman
a couple days' hope.

256
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:44,415
False hope.
If there was any other type available,
I would have given her that.

257
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:56,264
Why are you smelling Billy's pants?

258
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:58,599
I'm not.
Looked like you were.

259
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,831
- I was smelling the floor.
- Oh.

260
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:03,739
Do you have any pets in this class?

261
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:07,108
No. But we used to have a gerbil,
but Carly L. dropped a book on it.

262
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:09,113
Careless.

263
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:13,140
- Do you need to smell it?
- No. I'm smelling for mold.

264
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:15,152
I don't need to smell it.

265
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:19,452
- You could smell our parrot.
- You said you didn't have any pets in this class.

266
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:21,516
A parrot is a bird.

267
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:23,288
Listen,
Jackson's not the father--

268
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,523
Parrots are the primary source
of psittacosis.

269
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:27,292
It's not the parrot.

270
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:32,269
And psittacosis can lead to nerve problems
and neurological complications.

271
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,601
How many kids were in the class?
Twenty.

272
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,107
How many are home sick?
None, but--

273
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:42,808
None. But you figured
that five-year-olds are more serious
about bird hygiene than their teacher?

274
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:44,940
Have you been through her home?
She lives in Trenton.

275
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,214
I can go up to her room
tomorrow morning,
ask her for the key.

276
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:52,348
Would the police call for permission
before dropping by
to check out a crime scene?

277
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:56,155
It's not a crime scene.
As far as I know, she's running
a meth lab out of her basement.

278
00:19:56,228 --> 00:20:00,324
She's a kindergarten teacher.
And if I were a kindergarten student
I would trust her implicitly.

279
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,659
Okay. I'll give you a "for instance".

280
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:07,637
The lady back there...

281
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,140
who made your egg salad sandwich--

282
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,042
Her eyes look glassy.
Did you notice that?

283
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:16,547
Now, hospital policy
is to stay home if you're sick.

284
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:20,312
But if you're making $8.00 an hour,
then you kind of need
the $8.00 an hour, right?

285
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:24,822
And the sign in the bathroom
says that employees must wash
after using the facilities,

286
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:30,487
but I figure that somebody
who wipes snot on a sleeve isn't
hyperconcerned about sanitary conditions.

287
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,053
So what do you think--
should I trust her?

288
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:37,761
I want you to check the patient's home
for contaminants, garbage, medication.

289
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:41,567
I can't just break into someone's house.
Isn't that how you got into
the Felkers' home?

290
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:49,170
Yeah, I know.

291
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:53,275
Court records are sealed.
You were 16. It was a stupid mistake.

292
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:57,083
But your old gym teacher
has a big mouth.
Should write a thank-you note.

293
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:59,555
- I should thank him?
- Well--

294
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:04,625
I needed somebody around here
with street smarts.

295
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:10,363
Okay? Who knows
when they're being conned,
knows how to con.

296
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,027
I should sue you.

297
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:15,301
Pretty sure you can't sue somebody
for wrongful hiring.

298
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:20,073
But I'm pretty sure I can sue if you fire me
for not breaking into some lady's house.

299
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:35,125
Doing research.
People are fascinating, aren't they?

300
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:37,423
Why are you giving Adler steroids?

301
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:42,627
Because she's my patient.
That's what you do with patients--
you give them medicine.

302
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:44,635
You don't prescribe medicine
based on guesses.

303
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:46,796
At least we don't
since Tuskegee and Mengele.

304
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:49,807
You're comparing me to a Nazi?
Nice.

305
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,070
I'm stopping the treatment.

306
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:59,650
She's my patient.
It's my hospital.

307
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:01,652
I did not get her sick.

308
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,156
She is not an experiment.
I have a legitimate theory
about what's wrong with her.

309
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:07,157
With no proof.

310
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:08,157
There's never any proof.

311
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:11,787
Five different doctors
come up with five different diagnoses
based on the same evidence.

312
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:15,162
You don't have any evidence.

313
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:18,532
And nobody knows anything, huh?
Then how is it
you always think you're right?

314
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:22,505
I don't. I just find it hard to operate
on the opposite assumption.

315
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:25,509
And why are you so afraid
of making a mistake?

316
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:29,035
Because I'm a doctor.
Because when we make mistakes,
people die.

317
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:31,105
Oh, come on.

318
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:36,110
People used to have more
respect for cripples, you know.

319
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:41,115
They didn't really.

320
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:48,197
So how you feeling?
Much better, thanks.

321
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:50,894
Are you Dr. House?
I thought he was a he, but--

322
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:53,494
No.

323
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:56,598
Don't eat too much, too fast.

324
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:58,666
Thank him for me.

325
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:01,269
Right.

326
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:14,925
Should I discontinue
the treatment, boss?

327
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:16,984
You got lucky.

328
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:22,356
Cool, huh?

329
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:26,570
Okay, once again.

330
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:31,241
Good.

331
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:33,743
Am I ever gonna meet Dr. House?

332
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:38,511
Well, you might run into him
at the movies or on the bus.

333
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,608
Is he a good man?

334
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:44,348
He's a good doctor.

335
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,755
Can you be one without the other?

336
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:50,625
Don't you have to
care about people?
Caring is a good motivator.

337
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:53,797
He's found something else.

338
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:58,561
Feel this, both sides?
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

339
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:02,630
Okay, squeeze.
Harder. All right.

340
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:04,607
He's your friend, huh?

341
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:06,803
Yeah.

342
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:09,312
Does he care about you?

343
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:12,612
I think so.
You don't know?

344
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:15,915
As Dr. House likes to say,
"Everybody lies".

345
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:19,783
It's not what people say.
It's what they do.

346
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:26,287
Yeah.
He cares about me.

347
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:31,992
I can't see.

348
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:38,142
I can't... see.

349
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:47,917
A little help in here!

350
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:03,764
Your chest will be sore for a while.

351
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:06,804
We needed to shock you
to get your heart going.

352
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:14,609
Okay, can you arrange these
to tell a story?

353
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:30,160
She couldn't put them in order.

354
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:34,324
Could the damage have been caused
by a lack of oxygen during her seizure?

355
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:38,233
No. I gave her the same test
five minutes later.
She did just fine.

356
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:41,830
The altered mental status is intermittent,
just like the verbal skills.

357
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:43,841
So what now?

358
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:46,969
Given the latest symptoms,
it's clearly growing deeper into the brain stem.

359
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:49,411
Soon, she won't be able to walk.

360
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:52,917
She'll go blind permanently,
and then the respiratory center will fail.

361
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:54,918
How long do we have?

362
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:57,819
If it's a tumor,
we're talking a month or two.
If it's infectious, a few weeks.

363
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:02,451
If it's vascular,
that'll probably be fastest of all.
Maybe a week.

364
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:04,654
We're gonna stop all treatment.

365
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:09,326
I still think it's a tumor.
I think we should go back
to the radiation.

366
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,335
She didn't respond
to the radiation.

367
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:15,601
Well, maybe we didn't see the effect
until after we started steroids.
No, it's not a tumor.

368
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:18,643
Those steroids did something.
I just don't know what.

369
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,941
So we're just gonna do nothing?
We're just gonna watch her die?

370
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:26,541
Yeah, we're gonna watch her die.
Specifically, we're gonna watch
how fast she's dying.

371
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:30,213
You just told us--
each diagnosis has its own time frame.

372
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:33,485
When we see how fast it's killing her,
we'll know what it is.

373
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:36,493
And by then, maybe there's
nothing we can do about it.

374
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:38,620
There's got to be
something we can do.

375
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:40,562
Something better
than watching her die.

376
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:43,123
Well, I got nothing.

377
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:45,192
How about you?

378
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:51,575
Bastard.

379
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:54,578
Oh, Cameron.
I need you for a couple of hours.
What's up?

380
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:58,582
When you break into someone's house,
it's better to have a white chick with you.
Adler's house?

381
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:03,212
Why don't we just ask her for her keys?
For all we know, she'll be running
a meth lab out of her basement.

382
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,279
I'm tired a lot.

383
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:10,152
Any other reason why you think
you might have chronic fatigue syndrome?

384
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:12,253
It's kind of the definition, isn't it?

385
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,355
It's kind of the definition
of getting older.

386
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:20,029
I had a couple headaches last month,
a mild fever. Sometimes I can't sleep,
and I have trouble concentrating.

387
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:23,199
Apparently not while
researching this stuff on the Internet.

388
00:27:23,274 --> 00:27:27,074
I was thinking
it also might be fibromyalgia.

389
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:31,281
Excellent diagnosis.

390
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:33,249
Is there anything for that?

391
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:39,279
You know, I think there just might be.

392
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:43,259
I need 36 Vicodin
and change for a dollar.

393
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:07,647
Exam room two.

394
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:12,422
House doesn't believe in pretense.

395
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:15,789
Figures life's too short and too painful.
So he just says what he thinks.

396
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:19,325
Nothing interesting in the garbage.

397
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:22,161
"I say what I think" is just
another way of saying "I'm an assho"--

398
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:27,504
Well, if you wanted to be judged
for your medical prowess only,

399
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:30,006
maybe you shouldn't have
broken into someone's home.

400
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:32,066
I was 16.

401
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:36,603
Don't know about ticks,
but her dog's definitely got fleas.

402
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:42,344
I managed to make it to 17
without a criminal record.

403
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:47,357
Yeah?

404
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:51,361
Well, you obviously didn't grow up
in my neighborhood.

405
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:54,865
That's right. You stole a loaf of bread
to feed your starving family. Right?

406
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:56,867
You always eat during break-ins?

407
00:28:56,935 --> 00:29:00,371
Am I supposed to respect their food
more than I respect their DVD players?

408
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:01,871
You want some?
No.

409
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,306
You gonna go hungry until she dies?

410
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:05,672
No.
You know what?

411
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:08,975
After centuries of slavery,
decades of civil rights marches...

412
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:13,950
and, more significantly,
living like a monk,
never getting less than a 4.0 G.P.A.,

413
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:18,614
you don't think it's kind of disgusting
I get one of the top jobs in the country
because I'm a delinquent?

414
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:22,449
We'll eat,
then we'll tear up the carpet.

415
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,697
You went to Hopkins, right?

416
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,665
Yep.

417
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:31,998
So you went to a better school than I did.
You got better grades than I did.

418
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:35,005
So how did you get the job?

419
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:37,473
You stab a guy in a bar fight?

420
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:47,050
Nothing.

421
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:50,485
It's not a tumor.
She's getting worse too fast.

422
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:54,013
- She can't stand up.
- No toxins? No medications?

423
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:55,753
Nothing that would explain
these symptoms.

424
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:57,818
Family history
of neurological problems?

425
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:00,228
Not that I could tell
from her underwear drawer.

426
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,732
You said "nothing that would
explain these symptoms".

427
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,429
What did you find that
doesn't explain these symptoms?

428
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:10,764
Dr. Wilson convinced you
to treat this patient
under false pretenses.

429
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:12,935
Adler's not his cousin.

430
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:16,046
That's ridiculous. Ask her yourself.
Can we get ba--

431
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:18,605
- She's not jewish.
- Rachel Adler's not jewish?

432
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:22,175
I had ham at her apartment.

433
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:26,451
Dr. Foreman, a lot of Jews
have non-Jewish relatives,
and most of us don't keep kosher.

434
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:30,085
I can see getting through high school
without learning a thing about jews,
but medical school?

435
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:33,597
Okay, maybe she's Jewish,
but she's definitely not your cousin.

436
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,031
Really? This guy is--

437
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,763
You don't even know her name.
You called her Rachel.
Her name is Rebecca.

438
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:43,066
Yes. Yes, her name is Rebecca.

439
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:47,107
I-I call her Rachel.

440
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,544
You idiot!
Listen, he's--

441
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:51,605
Not you. Him.

442
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:55,449
- You said you didn't find anything.
- Everything I found was in my--

443
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,920
- You found ham.
- So?

444
00:30:57,989 --> 00:31:00,321
Where there's ham, there's pork.

445
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:03,224
Where there's pork,
there's neurocysticercosis.

446
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:05,819
Tapeworm? You think
she's got a worm in her brain?

447
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:08,422
It fits.
Could have been living there for years.
Never occurred to me that--

448
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:12,230
Millions of people eat ham every day.
It's quite a leap to think
that's she's got a tapeworm.

449
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:17,400
Okay, Mr. Neurologist,
what happens when you give steroids
to a person who has a tapeworm?

450
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:21,138
They-- They get a little better,
and-- and then they get worse.

451
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:26,775
Just like Rebecca Adler did.

452
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:39,988
In a typical case,
if you don't cook pork well enough,

453
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:43,556
you digest live tapeworm larvae.

454
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:45,865
They've got these little hooks,

455
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:48,269
they grab onto your bowel,
they live, they grow up, they reproduce.

456
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:52,708
Reproduce? There's only one lesion,
and it's nowhere near her bowel.

457
00:31:52,777 --> 00:31:55,143
That's because
this is not a typical case.

458
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:59,172
Tapeworm can produce
20,000 to 30,000 eggs a day.

459
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,184
Guess where they go?
Out.

460
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,186
Not all of them.

461
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:08,715
Unlike the larvae, the egg can pass
right through the walls of the intestines
into the bloodstream.

462
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:11,057
And where does the bloodstream go?
Everywhere.

463
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:15,327
As long as it's healthy, the immune system
doesn't even know it's there.

464
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:20,531
The worm builds a wall, uses secretions
to shut down the body's immune response
and control fluid flow.

465
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:23,403
It's really very beautiful.

466
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:26,034
As long as it's healthy.
So what do we do?

467
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:29,045
Call a vet,
nurse the little guy back to health?

468
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:32,048
It's too late for that.
It's dying.

469
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:36,519
And as it dies, this parasite loses
the ability to control the host's defenses.

470
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:40,580
The immune system wakes up,
attacks the worm,
and everything starts to swell.

471
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:43,684
And that is very bad for the brain.

472
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:46,389
It could still be
a hundred other things.

473
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,659
The eosinophil count was normal.

474
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:51,566
- It's only abnormal in 30% of cases.
- Proving nothing.

475
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:56,767
No, no, no, no. It--
Don't you see? It fits. It's perfect.
It explains everything.

476
00:32:56,841 --> 00:32:59,674
- But it proves nothing.
- I can prove it by treating it.

477
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:01,712
No, you can't.

478
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:05,374
I was just with her.
She doesn't want any more treatments.

479
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:08,942
She doesn't want any more experiments.
She wants to go home and die.

480
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,503
Would you excuse us, please?

481
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,745
I'm Dr. House.

482
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:43,378
It's good to meet you.

483
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:49,758
You're being an idiot.

484
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,923
You have a tapeworm
in your brain.

485
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:01,866
It's not pleasant,
but if we don't do anything,
you'll be dead by the weekend.

486
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:04,237
Have you actually seen the worm?

487
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:07,277
When you're all better,
I'll show you my diplomas.

488
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:10,109
You were sure
I had vasculitis too.

489
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:13,116
Now I can't walk
and I'm wearing a diaper.

490
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:15,209
What's this treatment
gonna do for me?

491
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:18,687
I'm not talking about a treatment.
I'm talking about a cure.

492
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:21,748
But because I might be wrong,
you want to die.

493
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:25,185
What made you a cripple?

494
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,091
I had an infarction.

495
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:33,603
A heart attack?

496
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:36,105
It's what happens
when blood flow is obstructed.

497
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:39,200
If it's in the heart, it's a heart attack.
If it's in the lungs, it's a pulmonary embolism.

498
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:42,212
If it's in the brain, it's a stroke.
I had it in my thigh muscles.

499
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,874
Wasn't there something
they could do?

500
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:48,112
There was plenty they could do,
if they'd made the right diagnosis.

501
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:51,087
But the only symptom was pain.

502
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:55,282
Not many people get to
experience muscle death.

503
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,054
Did you think you were dying?

504
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:59,722
I hoped I was dying.

505
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:03,800
So you hide in your office,
refuse to see patients...

506
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:07,497
because you don't like
the way people look at you.

507
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:11,770
You feel cheated by life, so now
you're gonna get even with the world.

508
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:14,778
But you want me to fight this.

509
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:16,780
Why?

510
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:19,817
What makes you think
I'm so much better than you?

511
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:22,978
What, you're scared
you'll turn into me?

512
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:26,319
I just want to die
with a little dignity.

513
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:28,688
There's no such thing.

514
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:32,024
Our bodies break down.
Sometimes when we're 90.
Sometimes before we're even born.

515
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:35,031
But it always happens,
and there's never any dignity in it.

516
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:40,002
I don't care if you can walk,
see, wipe your own ass.
It's always ugly. Always.

517
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:47,033
We can live with dignity.
We can't die with it.

518
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:06,853
No treatment.

519
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:11,198
Maybe we can get a court order,
uh, override her wishes,

520
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:14,204
claim she doesn't have the capacity
to make this decision.

521
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:16,206
But she does.

522
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:19,209
But we could claim that the illness
made her mentally incompetent, right?

523
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:21,711
A pretty common result.
That didn't happen here.

524
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:25,545
He's not gonna do it.
She's not just a file to him anymore.

525
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:27,550
He respects her.

526
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:30,314
So because you respect her,
you're going to let her die?

527
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:35,089
I solved the case.
My work is done.

528
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,226
Patients always want proof.

529
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:41,492
We're not making cars here.

530
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:43,932
We don't give guarantees.

531
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:47,594
I think we can prove it's a worm.

532
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:51,641
It's noninvasive. It's safe.

533
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:54,872
I'm not completely sure, but--
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What's the damn idea?

534
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:57,380
Have you ever seen a worm
under an X-ray?

535
00:36:57,448 --> 00:37:00,383
A regular, old, no-contrast,
hundred-year-old-technology X-ray?

536
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:04,581
They light up like shotgun pellets,
just like on a contrast M.R.I.

537
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:07,954
Which is the same thing as a CT scan,
which we did, which proved nothing.

538
00:37:08,025 --> 00:37:10,960
The worm's cyst is the same density
as the cerebrospinal fluid.

539
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:13,588
We're not gonna see anything
in her head.

540
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:17,122
But Chase is right. He's right.
We should X-ray her.

541
00:37:17,201 --> 00:37:20,136
But we don't X-ray her brain.
We X-ray her leg.

542
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:24,868
Worms love thigh muscle.
If she's got one in her head,
I guarantee you there's one in her leg.

543
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:40,222
Hold still, Rebecca.

544
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:51,232
This here...

545
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:53,236
is a worm larva.

546
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:55,898
So, if it's in my leg,
it's in my brain?

547
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:59,238
Are you looking for a guarantee?

548
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,835
It's there.
Probably been there six to 10 years.

549
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:05,177
- Do I have more?
- Probably.

550
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:08,676
It's good news.

551
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:11,745
- What do we do now?
- Now we get you better.

552
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:16,149
Albendazole.

553
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:22,262
- Two pills?
- Yeah. Every day,
for at least a month, with a meal.

554
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:24,893
- Two pills?
- Yeah.

555
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:30,271
Possible side effects
include abdominal pain, nausea,
headaches, dizziness, fever...

556
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:32,275
and hair loss.

557
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:35,210
We'll probably make you keep taking the pills
even if you get every one of those.

558
00:38:54,565 --> 00:38:56,795
Why did you hire me?

559
00:38:57,802 --> 00:39:00,566
- Does it matter?
- Kinda hard to work for a guy
who doesn't respect you.

560
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:02,663
- Why?
- Is that rhetorical?

561
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,334
No. It just seems that way
'cause you can't think of an answer.

562
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:09,342
Does it make a difference
what I think?

563
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:14,407
I'm a jerk. The only thing that matters
is what you think. Can you do the job?

564
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:17,784
You hired a black guy
because he had a juvenile record.
No.

565
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,789
It wasn't a racial thing.

566
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,791
I didn't see a black guy.

567
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:24,020
I just saw a doctor...

568
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:26,029
with a juvenile record.

569
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:29,032
I hired Chase
'cause his dad made a phone call.

570
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,227
I hired you...

571
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:33,429
because you are extremely pretty.

572
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:38,441
You hired me
to get into my pants?
I can't believe that that would shock you.

573
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:40,443
It's also not what I said.

574
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:42,706
No, I hired you
because you look good.

575
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,271
It's like having a nice piece of art
in the lobby.

576
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:47,783
- I was in the top of my class.
- But not the top.

577
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:51,344
I did an internship
at the Mayo Clinic.
Yeah. You were a very good applicant.

578
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:54,357
But not the best.
Would that upset you?
Really?

579
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:58,794
To think that you were hired
because of some genetic gift of beauty
instead of some genetic gift of intelligence?

580
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:01,297
I worked very hard
to get where I am.

581
00:40:01,365 --> 00:40:03,299
But you didn't have to.

582
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:07,565
People choose the paths
that gain them the greatest rewards
for the least amount of effort.

583
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:11,438
That's a law of nature,
and you defied it.
That's why I hired you.

584
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:14,444
You could have married rich.
You could have been a model.

585
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:18,039
You could have just shown up
and people would have given you stuff.
Lots of stuff.

586
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:21,482
But you didn't.
You worked your stunning little ass off.

587
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:23,986
Am I supposed to be flattered?

588
00:40:24,054 --> 00:40:26,488
Gorgeous women
do not go to medical school...

589
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:29,549
unless they're as damaged
as they are beautiful.

590
00:40:29,627 --> 00:40:31,561
Were you abused
by a family member?

591
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:33,426
- No.
- Sexually assaulted?

592
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:35,624
No!

593
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:37,564
But you are damaged, aren't you?

594
00:40:41,405 --> 00:40:45,171
I have to go.

595
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:51,008
I followed her.

596
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:55,484
- Oh.
- I couldn't stop thinking
about what that doctor said.

597
00:40:55,553 --> 00:40:58,147
- I told you not to listen to him.
He's an idiot.
- I was orange!

598
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:02,791
- I don't want to know what you found out.
- You don't care?

599
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,794
I'm your doctor.

600
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:07,797
You've been good to me
and good to this hospital.
Ofcourse I care.

601
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:11,323
But I don't see how this conversation
can end well for me.

602
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:14,667
Either your wife is having an affair,
or she's not having an affair,

603
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:17,673
and you have come here
because you rightly think I should fire him.

604
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:21,802
But I can't.
Even if it costs me your money.

605
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:25,212
The son of a bitch
is the best doctor we have.

606
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:32,722
Feeling any better?

607
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:34,724
I can't complain.

608
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:37,124
As you know,
the hospital has certain rules.

609
00:41:37,194 --> 00:41:41,062
And as you also know,
we tend to ignore them.

610
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:43,565
But I think this one's gonna be
a little obvious unless we get your help.

611
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:47,001
If anyone asks,
you have 11 daughters and five sons.

612
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:50,802
Hi! Look who's here!

613
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:54,709
It's so good to see you guys.
I missed you.

614
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:57,379
Is this for me?

615
00:41:57,448 --> 00:41:59,507
It's beautiful.

616
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:04,649
Oh, I love you guys.

617
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:07,691
I wanted to thank Dr. House,
but he never visited again.

618
00:42:07,758 --> 00:42:10,090
He cured you.
You didn't cure him.

619
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:16,256
Okay, I want a hug and a kiss
from every single one of you!
Get up here right now!

620
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:21,237
- There.
- Hold on.

621
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:23,535
She's converted.

622
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:28,237
You said she was your cousin.

623
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:30,246
Why would you lie?

624
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:33,112
It got you to take the case.

625
00:42:34,118 --> 00:42:37,952
You lied to a friend to save a stranger.
You don't think
that's kind of screwed up?

626
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:39,785
You've never lied to me?

627
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:42,382
I never lie.

628
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:45,019
Oh. Right.

629
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:49,026
- Why do we do this?
- Because we're doctors.

630
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:51,431
If we make mistakes, people die.

631
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:56,098
Dr. House?

632
00:42:56,173 --> 00:42:58,198
You have a patient.

633
00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:06,046
He says he needs a refill.

634
00:43:09,186 --> 00:43:11,211
Got change for a dollar?
