1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,667
OH. HOW THE...

2
00:00:16,467 --> 00:00:19,266
(House)
## WELL, I GUESS
IT WOULD BE NICE ##

3
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:22,200
## IF I COULD TOUCH
YOUR BODY ##

4
00:00:22,266 --> 00:00:25,166
## I KNOW NOT EVERYBODY ##

5
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:28,467
## HAS GOT A BODY LIKE YOU ##

6
00:00:28,533 --> 00:00:31,066
## BABY ##
YOU KNOW,

7
00:00:31,133 --> 00:00:35,934
MOST PEOPLE GO FOR THE HARDWOOD
OR CARPETING.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,934
I THINK GUITARS AND GARBAGE
WORK JUST AS WELL.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,900
GOT THE URGE TO PLAY
LAST NIGHT.

10
00:00:40,967 --> 00:00:42,600
HAD TO GO ALL THE WAY BACK
TO MY APARTMENT.

11
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:44,667
THOUGHT I'D SAVE
ON FUTURE TRIPS.

12
00:00:44,734 --> 00:00:48,367
HMM. IT'S VERY ECO-FRIENDLY
OF YOU.

13
00:00:48,433 --> 00:00:50,233
HOW ABOUT KEEPING DOWN
ON THE NOISE POLLUTION?

14
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,033
6:33. YOU SHOULD BE FLOSSING
BY NOW.

15
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,400
I'M NOT GOING TO WORK TODAY.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,500
I'M GOING HUNTING.

17
00:01:01,867 --> 00:01:03,700
AFTER I SLEEP IN.

18
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:10,033
AH. AH.

19
00:01:12,834 --> 00:01:15,967
OH.

20
00:01:16,033 --> 00:01:19,266
IS IT THAT TIME
OF YEAR AGAIN?

21
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:21,166
HE'S A SELF-IMPORTANT JERK.

22
00:01:21,233 --> 00:01:22,700
HE'S MY FRIEND.

23
00:01:22,767 --> 00:01:24,467
HE'S A SELF-IMPORTANT JERK.

24
00:01:24,533 --> 00:01:27,700
SEEMS TO BE
WHAT I'M ATTRACTED TO.

25
00:01:27,767 --> 00:01:30,133
GUY CALLS YOU JIM.
DOESN'T EVEN KNOW YOUR NAME.

26
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,533
JIM IS SHORT FOR JAMES.

27
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,533
NOW GO AWAY, LIM.

28
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:41,000
[gunshot]

29
00:01:41,066 --> 00:01:43,266
NICE SHOT, JIM.
OH, YEAH.

30
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:46,533
OH, YEAH.
I NAILED THAT TREE.

31
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,033
[loads bullet]
MAPLE SYRUP FOR DINNER.

32
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,200
WE SHOULD HAVE GOT
A GUIDE.

33
00:01:50,266 --> 00:01:51,500
OH, DOESN'T COUNT
AS NEW ADVENTURE

34
00:01:51,567 --> 00:01:53,233
IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE HOLDING
YOUR HAND.

35
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,300
ON THE OTHER HAND,
WE ARE HOLDING WEAPONS

36
00:01:55,367 --> 00:01:57,266
AND HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT WE'RE DOING.

37
00:01:57,333 --> 00:02:00,266
FUN.
WELL, WE NEED
TO SNEAK UP ON THEM.

38
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:02,300
I READ SOMEWHERE THAT
THE NATIVE AMERICANS SAY

39
00:02:02,367 --> 00:02:04,233
TURKEYS KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

40
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,967
SO I SHOULD STOP THINKING
ABOUT GERMAN PORN.

41
00:02:06,033 --> 00:02:07,834
NO, NO.
THAT'LL LURE THEM CLOSER.

42
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,400
[turkeys calling
and gobbling]

43
00:02:15,567 --> 00:02:18,200
[turkeys gobble and scatter]

44
00:02:18,266 --> 00:02:20,567
WE'RE TERRIBLE AT THIS.

45
00:02:20,633 --> 00:02:24,533
YEAH. WELL, AT LEAST IT'S COLD
AND MY NEW BOOTS LEAK.

46
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,834
WELL, IT'S ALMOST TIME
ANYWAY.

47
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,767
DID YOU BRING THE BAG?

48
00:02:43,633 --> 00:02:45,266
MAY 30, 2004.

49
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:46,600
10:07 A.M.

50
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,333
DR. WILSON INFORMED ME

51
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,934
THAT IF TREATMENT
DIDN'T GO WELL,

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,633
MY LEUKEMIA WOULD GIVE ME
ONLY SIX MORE MONTHS TO LIVE.

53
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,667
NOVEMBER 30, 2004.

54
00:02:53,734 --> 00:02:56,133
SIX MONTHS LATER,
I DIDN'T DIE.

55
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,266
AS LONG AS I AM ALIVE,

56
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,533
I WILL FIND NEW AND EXCITING
WAYS TO THANK YOU

57
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,000
FOR GIVING ME ANOTHER YEAR.

58
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:09,533
NOW MOVE VERY, VERY FAR

59
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,166
AWAY FROM THERE
SO THAT I CAN BE SURE

60
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:12,166
AND THANK YOU AGAIN
NEXT YEAR.

61
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,133
[clears throat]

62
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,433
[loads bullet]

63
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,100
THANKS, JIM.

64
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:37,000
ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE HOW MANY
MORE TURKEYS WE CAN MISS.

65
00:03:39,467 --> 00:03:42,066
[turkey call
groans impotently]

66
00:03:42,133 --> 00:03:43,166
YEAH, THIS WILL WORK.

67
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:47,200
[gunshot]

68
00:03:47,266 --> 00:03:48,700
WHAT THE HELL?
GOD.

69
00:03:48,767 --> 00:03:49,967
SORRY.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

70
00:03:50,033 --> 00:03:51,133
I CAN'T MOVE MY ARM.

71
00:03:55,767 --> 00:03:57,533
AM I HAVING A STROKE?

72
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,600
I DON'T KNOW.
[exhales]

73
00:04:03,133 --> 00:04:06,100
[Massive Attack'sTeardrop]

74
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:13,934
## ##

75
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,000
GOOD NEWS.

76
00:04:44,066 --> 00:04:45,633
HEAD CT DOESN'T SHOW
ANY SIGNS OF A STROKE.

77
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,100
SO HE'S GONNA BE OKAY,
RIGHT?

78
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,967
I CANNOT BELIEVE
HOW MUCH YOU'VE GROWN UP

79
00:04:50,033 --> 00:04:51,266
IN FIVE YEARS.

80
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,500
SHE'S...

81
00:04:53,567 --> 00:04:55,166
SHE'S NOT FAMILY.

82
00:04:55,233 --> 00:04:56,800
ASHLEY, MY GIRLFRIEND.

83
00:04:56,867 --> 00:04:58,200
NEW LIFE, NEW ADVENTURES.

84
00:04:58,266 --> 00:04:59,900
ASHLEY, MEET JIM.

85
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:00,967
IT'S GOOD TO MEET YOU.

86
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:02,300
SO THIS ARM THING,

87
00:05:02,367 --> 00:05:03,800
DOES THAT MEAN
HIS LEUKEMIA'S BACK?

88
00:05:03,867 --> 00:05:07,033
I CHECKED BLOOD COUNTS
AND BLOOD CELL MORPHOLOGIES.

89
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,166
EVERYTHING IS NORMAL.

90
00:05:08,233 --> 00:05:10,166
SO THESE BLOOD TESTS,

91
00:05:10,233 --> 00:05:11,767
IT MEANS IT'S NOT CANCER
FOR SURE.

92
00:05:11,834 --> 00:05:12,967
HE SAID I'M FINE.

93
00:05:13,033 --> 00:05:14,100
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS?

94
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,100
HOPEFULLY SOMETHING
INNOCUOUS.

95
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,233
THERE'S A DOCTOR I CAN SPEAK TO
WHO'S GREAT...

96
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,033
WHO'S GREAT
AT DIAGNOSING...

97
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,200
WHAT?

98
00:05:24,266 --> 00:05:26,100
SORRY, THAT COLD SORE,

99
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,133
HOW LONG
HAVE YOU HAD THAT?

100
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,667
UM, TWO WEEKS.
I'M SORRY.

101
00:05:28,734 --> 00:05:29,900
I-I GOT THE CALL.

102
00:05:29,967 --> 00:05:31,100
I DIDN'T HAVE TIME
TO COVER IT UP.

103
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:32,133
WHAT IS IT, JIM?

104
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,066
[laughs]

105
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:36,967
THAT COLD SORE IS CAUSED
BY A VIRUS.

106
00:05:37,033 --> 00:05:38,567
ASSUMING YOU GUYS KISS,

107
00:05:38,633 --> 00:05:41,367
THE VIRUS COULD TRANSFER,
INFECT YOUR SPINE,

108
00:05:41,433 --> 00:05:42,700
AND CAUSE THE PARALYSIS.

109
00:05:42,767 --> 00:05:44,166
IT'S A DISEASE CALLED
TRANSVERSE MYELITIS.

110
00:05:44,233 --> 00:05:45,867
AND IS THAT GOOD NEWS
OR BAD NEWS?

111
00:05:45,934 --> 00:05:47,233
IT'S GREAT NEWS.

112
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,600
I'LL GET YOU A ROOM
AND START YOU ON ACYCLOVIR.

113
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:26,300
I JUST HAD A HOUSE MOMENT.

114
00:06:26,367 --> 00:06:29,033
DIAGNOSED TRANSVERSE MYELITIS
FROM A COLD SORE.

115
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,367
HOW COOL IS THAT?

116
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,967
PATIENTS REALLY EAT
THAT CRAP UP.

117
00:06:34,033 --> 00:06:35,633
IT'S WHY I'M LOVED.

118
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,533
WHAT AM I DOING HERE?
(Thirteen)
ULTRASOUND IS CLEAR.

119
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,100
WHICH MEANS HE'S DEFINITELY
NOT PREGNANT, RIGHT?

120
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,133
DIOS MIO, MI ESTOMAGO!

121
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,300
NO GALL STONES.

122
00:06:43,367 --> 00:06:45,333
COULD BE DIVERTICULITIS.

123
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,266
HAVE YOU EATEN
ANY SEEDS?

124
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:48,767
(patient)
I'M JOINING YOU,
ANTONIO AGUILAR.

125
00:06:48,834 --> 00:06:51,467
WE'LL PLAY IN GOD'S
MARIACHI BAND.

126
00:06:51,533 --> 00:06:52,900
DRAW SOME BLOOD.

127
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,033
THE SELF-IMPORTANT JERK
DOES NOT HAVE

128
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,567
TRANSVERSE MYELITIS.

129
00:06:57,633 --> 00:06:59,100
HE'S GOT CANCER.

130
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:00,266
HOW DO YOU EVEN--

131
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,367
OKAY.

132
00:07:02,433 --> 00:07:04,433
MAYBE I PAID THE REDHEAD
DOWN IN RECORDS A FEW BUCKS

133
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,533
TO CC ME
ON ALL YOUR CASES.

134
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,800
A FEW PATIENTS DIE,
YOU MIGHT GET SAD AGAIN.

135
00:07:08,867 --> 00:07:10,667
MAKE A SPEECH
THAT WOULD END YOUR CAREER.

136
00:07:10,734 --> 00:07:13,433
FRANKLY,
I'M STALKING YOU FOR YOU.

137
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,400
HOW LONG DOES A SIMPLE
BLOOD DRAW TAKE?

138
00:07:15,467 --> 00:07:16,934
ALMOST FINISHED.
WELL,
WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED

139
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,967
ALMOST FINISHING IT,
TEST IT.

140
00:07:19,033 --> 00:07:21,166
MI ESTOMAGO'SRIPPED OPEN
BY THE HAND OF GOD.

141
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:22,300
HE SPILLED MY BLOOD.

142
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,166
CONFUSION. DELIRIUM.

143
00:07:24,233 --> 00:07:27,266
WHY RULE OUT
THE HAND OF GOD SO FAST?

144
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:28,800
YOUR GUY'S LOW WHITE COUNT

145
00:07:28,867 --> 00:07:31,000
AND RIGHT ARM PARALYSIS
EQUALS A RECURRENCE

146
00:07:31,066 --> 00:07:32,400
OF HIS LEUKEMIA.

147
00:07:32,467 --> 00:07:34,967
SIMPLE MATH.

148
00:07:35,033 --> 00:07:36,200
DID YOU LOOK PAST

149
00:07:36,266 --> 00:07:38,100
THE FIRST PAGE
OF THE FILE?

150
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,734
NO AML CELLS ANYWHERE.

151
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,800
I DID THE BLOOD SMEARS
MYSELF.

152
00:07:40,867 --> 00:07:42,300
IT'S STILL CANCER.

153
00:07:42,367 --> 00:07:44,734
YOU KNOW HOW I KNOW?

154
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,000
HE'S GOT AN ONCOLOGIST
FOR A DOCTOR.

155
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:49,233
AND YOUR MAGICAL
LEUKEMIA DETECTOR

156
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,967
IS MORE POWERFUL
THAN A FLOW CYTOMETER?

157
00:07:51,033 --> 00:07:53,333
I LOOK FOR ZEBRAS
BECAUSE OTHER DOCTORS

158
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,967
RULE OUT ALL THE HORSES.

159
00:07:55,033 --> 00:07:56,900
IN THIS CASE,
YOU ARE THOSE OTHER DOCTORS.

160
00:07:56,967 --> 00:07:58,900
YOU HAVEN'T EARNED
A ZEBRA.

161
00:07:58,967 --> 00:08:01,400
100 BUCKS.
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

162
00:08:01,467 --> 00:08:03,734
LOOK, FRIENDS DON'T DIAGNOSE
FRIENDS WITH CANCER.

163
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,967
I GET IT.

164
00:08:05,033 --> 00:08:07,000
YOUR PROBLEM IS
YOU'RE NOT OBJECTIVE.

165
00:08:07,066 --> 00:08:09,266
YOUR CARING IS CLOUDING
YOUR DIAGNOSIS.

166
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,500
JUST CUT THAT OUT

167
00:08:10,567 --> 00:08:12,800
AND YOU COULD BE
A PRETTY DECENT DOCTOR.

168
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,967
JUST GIVE ME
THE LACTIC ACID LEVEL.

169
00:08:15,033 --> 00:08:16,000
27.

170
00:08:16,066 --> 00:08:17,233
[inhales]

171
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,433
THE FACT THAT YOU CAN'T
SPEAK ENGLISH

172
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,800
IS NOT AN EXCUSE
FOR YOU NOT BEING HUMILIATED

173
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:22,300
BY WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY.

174
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:24,367
IT'S ALSO NOT AN EXCUSE
FOR YOU NOT TELLING US

175
00:08:24,433 --> 00:08:25,900
THAT YOU WERE A TENNIS PRO.

176
00:08:25,967 --> 00:08:28,700
IF YOU HAD, WE WOULDN'T
HAVE WASTED OUR TIME.
FINE.

177
00:08:28,767 --> 00:08:30,967
100 BUCKS.

178
00:08:31,033 --> 00:08:34,367
[patient screams]

179
00:08:34,433 --> 00:08:36,000
IS TUCKER SETTLING IN?

180
00:08:36,066 --> 00:08:38,400
YEAH. ALREADY GOT
HIS FIRST DOSE OF ACYCLOVIR.

181
00:08:38,467 --> 00:08:39,600
AND DON'T WORRY,

182
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:41,000
I ORDERED HIS GIRLFRIEND
THE KIDDY MEAL.

183
00:08:41,066 --> 00:08:43,266
HOO-AH.
NEXT PATIENT ON DECK.

184
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,867
DEL CLINTON.
DAY SIX OF CHEMO.

185
00:08:44,934 --> 00:08:46,066
YOU JUST MISSED
THE GRANDKIDS.

186
00:08:46,133 --> 00:08:48,133
OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

187
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,000
LAST TIME THEY WERE HERE,
THEY PAINTED MY TIE.

188
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,600
YOU'RE ALMOST READY
TO GO HOME.

189
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:56,934
YOU FEELING OKAY?

190
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,667
I FEEL LIKE I FELT
AFTER THE LAST FOUR ROUNDS.

191
00:09:00,734 --> 00:09:03,333
IN ONCOLOGY, FAMILIAR PAIN
MEANS ALL IS WELL.

192
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,967
SO THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT?

193
00:09:05,033 --> 00:09:06,700
YEAH.
[pager sounds]

194
00:09:06,767 --> 00:09:08,100
I HEARD JESSE AND ZEKE
WERE BY EARLIER.

195
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,200
YEAH.

196
00:09:10,266 --> 00:09:13,700
SORRY, DEL, I GOTTA RUN.

197
00:09:18,033 --> 00:09:19,200
HOW ARE THEY DOING?

198
00:09:19,266 --> 00:09:21,100
THEY--THEY'RE FINE.

199
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:24,500
NO GAME-WINNING HITS?
NO ACED REPORT CARDS?

200
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:25,533
NO SCHOOL PLAYS?

201
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,066
I GUESS NOT.

202
00:09:28,133 --> 00:09:30,066
I THOUGHT YOU HAD TO GO.

203
00:09:33,734 --> 00:09:34,667
ARE YOU DEPRESSED?

204
00:09:34,734 --> 00:09:36,467
I HAVE CANCER.

205
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:38,967
YOU'VE HAD CANCER
FOR A LONG TIME.

206
00:09:39,033 --> 00:09:40,834
IT'S NEVER STOPPED YOU
FROM BRAGGING

207
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,333
ABOUT THE GRANDKIDS.

208
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,867
I GUESS I'M FEELING A LITTLE
MORE DOWN THAN USUAL.

209
00:09:45,934 --> 00:09:47,667
CAN YOU GIVE ME SOMETHING?

210
00:09:47,734 --> 00:09:50,567
YEAH. I DON'T WANT YOU
TO GET ALARMED,

211
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:52,500
BUT SOMETIMES DEPRESSION
CAN BE A SIGN

212
00:09:52,567 --> 00:09:54,133
THAT SOMETHING ELSE
IS GOING ON.

213
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,667
I'M JUST GONNA ORDER
A COUPLE OF EXTRA TESTS.

214
00:09:56,734 --> 00:09:58,100
OKAY?

215
00:10:05,266 --> 00:10:07,300
WHAT'S GOING ON?
IT'S HIS FOOT NOW.

216
00:10:07,367 --> 00:10:08,967
IT'S NOTHING.
IT'S NOT NOTHING.

217
00:10:09,033 --> 00:10:11,400
I JUST STARTED GETTING
A LITTLE TINGLING FEELING

218
00:10:11,467 --> 00:10:13,734
IN MY FOOT.

219
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,834
IS THAT BAD?

220
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,000
ASHLEY,
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

221
00:10:16,066 --> 00:10:18,033
IT MIGHT MEAN HIS FOOT
FELL ASLEEP.

222
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,333
IT MIGHT MEAN NOTHING.

223
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,934
COULD YOU GIVE US
A FEW MINUTES?

224
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,200
WHAT--WHY CAN'T YOU
TELL ME?

225
00:10:22,266 --> 00:10:24,266
BECAUSE
YOU'RE MAKING HIM NERVOUS.

226
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:27,100
JUST GIVE US A FEW MINUTES,
OKAY, HON?

227
00:10:29,433 --> 00:10:30,834
DOES THIS MEAN
THAT IT'S NOT THE DISEASE

228
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,100
YOU THOUGHT IT WAS?

229
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,700
IT MEANS THE MEDICINE
I GAVE YOU IS NOT WORKING.

230
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:35,300
I JUST MIGHT HAVE
TO HIT IT HARDER.

231
00:10:35,367 --> 00:10:38,567
I'M GOING TO ADD RIBAVIRIN
TO YOUR TREATMENT.

232
00:10:38,633 --> 00:10:40,867
JIM.

233
00:10:40,934 --> 00:10:42,633
ARE YOU SURE THAT
THIS ISN'T A RECURRENCE?

234
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,967
SO THE BRAVE FACE
IS JUST FOR ASHLEY.

235
00:10:45,033 --> 00:10:47,667
SHE'S YOUNG.
SHE'S TERRIFIED.

236
00:10:47,734 --> 00:10:49,066
SHE'S NOT REALLY
EQUIPPED.
DON'T WORRY.

237
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:52,400
ONCE YOU'VE HAD CANCER,

238
00:10:52,467 --> 00:10:54,633
RECURRENCE IS YOUR BIGGEST FEAR.
I GET IT.

239
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,300
I'VE LOOKED AT THIS THING
EVERY WHICH WAY THERE IS.

240
00:10:57,367 --> 00:10:58,734
THAT'S NOT
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.

241
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,967
CAN YOU CALL MY DAUGHTER
AND ASK HER TO COME DOWN?

242
00:11:02,033 --> 00:11:03,600
YOU CAN'T DO IT?

243
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:06,633
SHE HASN'T EXACTLY
BEEN TALKING TO ME

244
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,200
SINCE I GOT TOGETHER
WITH ASHLEY.

245
00:11:08,266 --> 00:11:11,900
I'D REALLY LIKE HER
TO BE HERE.

246
00:11:11,967 --> 00:11:13,400
OF COURSE.

247
00:11:16,266 --> 00:11:17,533
EXACTLY HOW SERIOUS
DOES IT HAVE TO BE

248
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,400
TO JUSTIFY YOU COMING
TO SEE YOUR FATHER?

249
00:11:21,467 --> 00:11:23,133
NO. I'M SORRY.

250
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,333
I JUST--I'D RATHER
YOU REGRETTED COMING

251
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,266
THAN REGRETTED NOT COMING.

252
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,166
THANKS, EMILY.

253
00:11:32,433 --> 00:11:33,867
HOW'S TUCKER?

254
00:11:33,934 --> 00:11:36,100
OH, WELL, HE'S MADE A MESS
OF HIS PERSONAL LIFE.

255
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,633
BUT PHYSICALLY,
I THINK HE'S GONNA BE FINE.

256
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,333
TRANSVERSE MYELITIS.

257
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,533
WHAT DOES HOUSE THINK?

258
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,667
WHAT IS THIS?

259
00:11:42,734 --> 00:11:44,233
IS HOUSE MY OVERSEER NOW?

260
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,834
NO, IT'S JUST NOT ALWAYS
A GOOD IDEA

261
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,967
FOR DOCTORS TO TREAT

262
00:11:48,033 --> 00:11:49,166
THEIR FRIENDS,
THAT'S ALL.

263
00:11:49,233 --> 00:11:51,400
WELL, HOUSE HAS GOT
100 BUCKS ON CANCER.

264
00:11:51,467 --> 00:11:53,367
SO UNLESS YOU WANT IN
ON THE ACTION...

265
00:11:53,433 --> 00:11:56,467
UM, IS BONNIE
STILL A REALTOR?

266
00:11:56,533 --> 00:11:58,166
AS FAR AS I KNOW.

267
00:11:58,233 --> 00:12:00,333
DO YOU MIND
IF I CALL HER?

268
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,600
I'M, UH, LOOKING
FOR A NEW PLACE.

269
00:12:03,667 --> 00:12:06,233
I'M MOVING IN WITH LUCAS.

270
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,367
(Taub)
IT WASN'T THE TENNIS.

271
00:12:07,433 --> 00:12:10,533
YOU'RE MOVING IN
WITH LUCAS?

272
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,500
YES.

273
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:14,633
YOU'RE BONNIE'S FRIEND.

274
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,066
YOU KNOW
HOW TO REACH HER.

275
00:12:16,133 --> 00:12:17,900
AND YET INSTEAD
OF CALLING HER,

276
00:12:17,967 --> 00:12:19,433
YOU COME AND SEEK
MY PERMISSION.

277
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,900
YOU WANT MY BLESSING,

278
00:12:20,967 --> 00:12:22,734
AND IMPLICITLY,
HOUSE'S BLESSING.

279
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,333
I DON'T NEED
HOUSE'S BLESSING.

280
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,567
GOOD.

281
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,100
SO WHEN WILL HE BE ABLE
TO MOVE HIS ARM AGAIN?

282
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,633
SHOULD BE SOON.
[coughs]

283
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,700
STARTED SMOKING AGAIN?

284
00:12:38,767 --> 00:12:40,300
[coughs] NO.

285
00:12:40,367 --> 00:12:42,700
WHAT--WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
IS IT BAD THAT HE'S COUGHING?

286
00:12:42,767 --> 00:12:45,367
HI, DAD.
HEY.

287
00:12:45,433 --> 00:12:47,533
MELISSA, HEY.
[clears throat]

288
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,567
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE COMING.

289
00:12:48,633 --> 00:12:50,166
I WAS AT MOM'S HOUSE

290
00:12:50,233 --> 00:12:51,266
WHEN DR. WILSON CALLED.

291
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:52,600
I CAN GO
IF IT'S GONNA BE WEIRD.

292
00:12:52,667 --> 00:12:55,433
[coughs] NO, NO. STAY.
IT'S FINE.

293
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,066
HI.
HOW ARE YOU?

294
00:12:57,133 --> 00:12:58,100
IS HE OKAY?

295
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:00,266
YEAH. HE'S OKAY.

296
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:02,400
I'M NOT A BIG FAN
OF THIS COUGHING THOUGH.

297
00:13:02,467 --> 00:13:03,500
YOU MUST BE ASHLEY.

298
00:13:03,567 --> 00:13:06,066
HI.
[coughs]

299
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:08,500
HEY, ARE YOU OKAY?
[gasping]

300
00:13:08,567 --> 00:13:10,767
DO YOU THINK
THIS COLD SORE THING

301
00:13:10,834 --> 00:13:12,000
COULD'VE CAUSED THIS?

302
00:13:12,066 --> 00:13:13,567
NO. WHATEVER'S CAUSING THIS

303
00:13:13,633 --> 00:13:15,166
IS AFFECTING MORE THAN
HIS NERVES.

304
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:16,934
I NEED A CRASH CART
IN HERE!

305
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,166
[coughing and gasping]

306
00:13:23,934 --> 00:13:25,734
DON'T YOU GUYS HAVE
A DYING MEXICAN CROONER

307
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,767
TO ATTEND TO?
HE ISN'T DYING ANYMORE.

308
00:13:27,834 --> 00:13:29,900
FOUND OUT
HE WAS ON A POPCORN DIET.

309
00:13:29,967 --> 00:13:32,500
EATING TEN BAGS
OF MICROWAVE POPCORN A DAY.

310
00:13:32,567 --> 00:13:34,166
HUFFING THE FUMES
SCARED HIS LUNGS.

311
00:13:34,233 --> 00:13:38,700
WOW, THAT'S...
VERY STRANGE.

312
00:13:38,767 --> 00:13:39,967
WHERE'S HOUSE?

313
00:13:40,033 --> 00:13:42,000
PERFORMING HIS RITUAL
"HIDING FROM CUDDY

314
00:13:42,066 --> 00:13:43,900
TO AVOID GETTING
A NEW CASE" DANCE.

315
00:13:43,967 --> 00:13:46,734
IT'S SORT OF A JAZZ-FUSION
TYPE OF THING.

316
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,433
HE'S PROBABLY EATING LUNCH
IN THE MORGUE.

317
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,400
I CAN PAGE HIM TO YOUR OFFICE
IF YOU WANT.
ACTUALLY...

318
00:13:50,467 --> 00:13:52,867
MAYBE IT WOULD BE BETTER
IF I TALKED TO YOU GUYS ALONE.

319
00:13:52,934 --> 00:13:55,600
HOUSE AND I HAVE A BET
ABOUT ONE OF MY PATIENTS.

320
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:58,400
YOU GUYS MIND MAKING HIM
100 BUCKS POORER?

321
00:14:00,734 --> 00:14:03,233
43-YEAR-OLD MALE
IN REMISSION FROM LEUKEMIA

322
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,500
PRESENTS WITH LEFT ARM PARALYSIS
AND TROUBLE BREATHING.

323
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,767
I ASSUME HOUSE'S MONEY
IS ON CANCER.

324
00:14:07,834 --> 00:14:08,934
THANKS.
THAT'S VERY HELPFUL.

325
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,500
SUBDURAL HEMATOMA
WOULD EXPLAIN--

326
00:14:10,567 --> 00:14:11,834
CT RULED IT OUT.

327
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,567
I THOUGHT IT WAS TM
SO I STARTED HIM ON ANTIVIRALS,

328
00:14:13,633 --> 00:14:14,600
BUT HE GOT WORSE.

329
00:14:14,667 --> 00:14:15,900
BACTERIAL INFECTION?

330
00:14:15,967 --> 00:14:17,500
BACTERIA WOULD MOVE
MUCH FASTER THAN THIS.

331
00:14:17,567 --> 00:14:18,500
HE'D BE DEAD ALREADY.

332
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:20,333
COULD BE FUNGAL.

333
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,300
FUNGAL INFECTION WOULD EXPLAIN
HIS BREATHING PROBLEM,

334
00:14:22,367 --> 00:14:24,000
BUT NOT HIS "UNABLE TO MOVE
HIS ARM" PROBLEM.

335
00:14:24,066 --> 00:14:28,033
ACTUALLY,
IF ASPERGILLUS FUNGUS BALLS

336
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,567
TOOK ROOT IN HIS LUNGS
AND SPREAD TO HIS SPINE,

337
00:14:31,633 --> 00:14:34,300
IT WOULD EXPLAIN BOTH.

338
00:14:34,367 --> 00:14:36,233
THANKS.

339
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,266
THE TREATMENT INVOLVES RIDDLING
THE INFECTED AREA

340
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,767
WITH BB-SIZED PELLETS
OF ANTIFUNGAL MEDS.

341
00:14:43,834 --> 00:14:46,300
I ASSUME YOU DON'T JUST
LOAD UP THE 12-GAUGE

342
00:14:46,367 --> 00:14:48,166
AND PEPPER ME
WITH BIRDSHOT.

343
00:14:48,233 --> 00:14:51,400
NO. WE HAVE A SLIGHTLY
MORE HUMANE DELIVERY SYSTEM.

344
00:14:51,467 --> 00:14:53,967
BUT WE DO HAVE TO OPEN YOU UP.
IT IS SURGERY.

345
00:14:54,033 --> 00:14:55,800
AND LIKE ANY OPERATION,

346
00:14:55,867 --> 00:14:57,567
THERE ARE RISKS.

347
00:14:57,633 --> 00:15:00,900
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
HONEY?

348
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:02,734
I-I DON'T KNOW.

349
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,533
I MEAN, IS SURGERY
REALLY SUCH A GOOD IDEA?

350
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,600
HE JUST SEEMS SO SICK.

351
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:07,367
I JUST--

352
00:15:07,433 --> 00:15:10,667
YOU SHOULD DO
WHATEVER YOU THINK IS BEST.

353
00:15:10,734 --> 00:15:12,333
IS THIS THE ONLY WAY

354
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,133
TO GO AFTER THIS THING?

355
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,600
BECAUSE OF THE RAPID
PROGRESSION,

356
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:17,734
I DON'T THINK WE HAVE TIME
TO TEST OR TRY IVs.

357
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,300
AND HE'S STRONG ENOUGH
TO ENDURE ANESTHESIA.

358
00:15:19,367 --> 00:15:20,467
DEFINITELY.

359
00:15:20,533 --> 00:15:22,033
I WANT YOU THERE
DURING THE SURGERY.

360
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,100
OF COURSE.

361
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,400
YOU GOTTA DO IT.

362
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,734
GOOD. DR. CHASE
WILL BE IN HERE SOON

363
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,800
TO GET YOU SET FOR THE O.R.

364
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:37,266
PAGE DR. CHASE TO TUCKER'S ROOM
FOR A SURGERY CONSULT.

365
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,467
AND CAN YOU GET ME--

366
00:15:38,533 --> 00:15:40,567
UH, MR. KOPLOVITZ WANTS
TO TALK TO YOU.

367
00:15:40,633 --> 00:15:41,800
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

368
00:15:41,867 --> 00:15:42,967
HE WANTED TO TALK
TO HIS DOCTOR,

369
00:15:43,033 --> 00:15:44,734
NOT HIS DOCTOR'S ASSISTANT.

370
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,700
OH, AND HOUSE IS LOOKING
FOR YOU.

371
00:15:46,767 --> 00:15:48,567
WHAT DID YOU TELL HIM?
THAT YOU WERE
IN THE CLINIC.

372
00:15:48,633 --> 00:15:50,800
I FIGURE THAT GIVES YOU
ABOUT TEN MINUTES.

373
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:53,000
HERE.
MR. KOPLOVITZ'S CHART. GO.

374
00:15:57,133 --> 00:15:58,266
HELLO, SAUL.

375
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,867
I HEARD YOU WERE LOOKING
FOR ME.

376
00:15:59,934 --> 00:16:01,033
I'M VERY TIRED.

377
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,400
BUT I CAN'T SLEEP.

378
00:16:03,467 --> 00:16:04,767
TODAY'S YOUR LUCKY DAY.

379
00:16:04,834 --> 00:16:07,667
I HAPPEN TO BE
A SLEEP SPECIALIST.

380
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:09,767
THANKS, DOC.

381
00:16:12,633 --> 00:16:14,767
[toilet flushes]

382
00:16:23,934 --> 00:16:25,867
HEY. CAN A GUY GET
A LITTLE PRIVACY?

383
00:16:25,934 --> 00:16:27,266
NICE HIDING SPOT.

384
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:28,767
ACTUALLY, IT'S PERFECT.

385
00:16:28,834 --> 00:16:31,800
IT ALLOWS ME TO HIDE FROM CUDDY
AND FIND YOU.

386
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:33,633
WHAT DID SHE WANT?

387
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,867
SHE WAS CHECKING UP ON TUCKER
THANKS TO YOU.

388
00:16:35,934 --> 00:16:36,967
THAT'S IT?

389
00:16:37,033 --> 00:16:40,300
LIKE WHAT?
SOMETHING ABOUT YOU?

390
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:42,567
SOMETHING YOU COULD INTERPRET
AS BEING ABOUT YOU?

391
00:16:42,633 --> 00:16:44,567
AN ANAGRAM MAYBE?

392
00:16:44,633 --> 00:16:46,667
IT'D BE GREAT IF YOU COULD PLAY
HIDE AND SEEK SOMEWHERE ELSE.

393
00:16:46,734 --> 00:16:48,100
MY PATIENT JUST--
NO PROBLEM.

394
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:50,000
JUST GIVE ME THE 100 BUCKS
YOU OWE ME AND I'M GONE.

395
00:16:50,066 --> 00:16:51,166
TUCKER DOESN'T HAVE CANCER.

396
00:16:51,233 --> 00:16:53,233
HE DOESN'T HAVE
A BALL OF FUNGUS

397
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,333
IN HIS LUNGS EITHER.

398
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,600
NEXT TIME YOU WANT
TO USE MY TEAM,

399
00:16:55,667 --> 00:16:56,934
I SUGGEST
YOU AT LEAST LEAVE A TIP.

400
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,200
I'M LATE FOR SURGERY.

401
00:17:00,266 --> 00:17:01,433
AH, YOUR ASSISTANT SAID
YOU'D BE IN HERE.

402
00:17:01,567 --> 00:17:02,934
I TALKED TO BONNIE.

403
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,100
LET'S TAKE THIS OUTSIDE.

404
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:05,834
MR. KOPLOVITZ
JUST GOT TO SLEEP.

405
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,834
OH, SORRY. SHE FOUND US
THIS FANTASTIC LOFT.

406
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,200
OUTSIDE.
I MEAN,
IT'S NOT A LOFT REALLY,

407
00:17:09,266 --> 00:17:10,300
IT'S JUST MORE URBAN.

408
00:17:10,367 --> 00:17:11,500
NOT THAT I'M URBAN,
BUT I USED TO BE.

409
00:17:11,567 --> 00:17:12,967
IT'S GOT TWO BEDROOMS.
GOT WONDERFUL VIEWS.

410
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:14,266
IT'S A REALLY GREAT PLACE.

411
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,166
PROCEDURE SHOULD TAKE
ABOUT AN HOUR.

412
00:17:16,233 --> 00:17:18,233
I'LL BE OBSERVING
THE ENTIRE TIME.

413
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,867
THANKS.

414
00:17:19,934 --> 00:17:22,100
MAYBE IT'D BE BETTER
IF YOU STAYED WITH ASHLEY.

415
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,567
SHE'S MORE SCARED
THAN I AM.

416
00:17:23,633 --> 00:17:27,734
[chuckles]
WELL, SHE'S...

417
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,033
AT HER AGE...

418
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,934
SHE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE DEALING
WITH ISSUES OF LIFE AND DEATH.

419
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,400
WASN'T WHAT I WAS PLANNING
WHEN I WENT AFTER HER.

420
00:17:37,467 --> 00:17:39,033
WHY DID YOU LEAVE MELISSA?

421
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:43,066
WE GOT MARRIED YOUNG.
WE...

422
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,033
I'M NOT SURE.

423
00:17:59,567 --> 00:18:01,000
[door opens]

424
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,033
THERE'S NOTHING
TO TALK ABOUT.

425
00:18:07,867 --> 00:18:09,400
WHY ARE YOU DOING SURGERY
WHEN I NEED YOU

426
00:18:09,467 --> 00:18:10,767
FINDING ME A NEW CASE?

427
00:18:10,834 --> 00:18:12,834
YOU DON'T WANT
A NEW CASE.

428
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,200
OH, RIGHT.

429
00:18:14,266 --> 00:18:16,600
GUESS I'M HERE FOR WILSON.

430
00:18:18,567 --> 00:18:19,800
OBVIOUSLY
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME

431
00:18:19,867 --> 00:18:21,467
THAT CUDDY WAS MOVING IN
WITH LUCAS

432
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:22,667
'CAUSE YOU WERE
PROTECTING ME.

433
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:25,266
WHICH IS ODD
SINCE I TOLD YOU

434
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,734
THAT I'M FINE
WITH THEIR RELATIONSHIP.

435
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,500
SO OBVIOUSLY,

436
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:31,100
YOU QUESTION
ONE OF THOSE ASSUMPTIONS

437
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:32,633
OR YOU HAVE AN ISSUE
WITH LOGIC.

438
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,266
YES, YOU'RE FINE
WITH THEM DATING.

439
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:37,467
BUT MOVING IN TOGETHER

440
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,767
IS A WHOLE OTHER LEVEL
OF COMMITMENT.

441
00:18:39,834 --> 00:18:42,000
[scoffs] THIS IS
THE 21ST CENTURY, WILSON.

442
00:18:42,066 --> 00:18:44,166
I REALIZE
THAT THE LOGICAL COURSE

443
00:18:44,233 --> 00:18:46,133
OF ANY ADULT RELATIONSHIP

444
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,066
COULD ONE DAY LEAD
TO FORNICATION.

445
00:18:49,133 --> 00:18:52,533
ALTHOUGH, THE FACT
THAT SHE WANTS TO BUY A LOFT

446
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,367
COULD ACTUALLY MEAN
THAT THEIR RELATIONSHIP

447
00:18:55,433 --> 00:18:56,467
IS NOT AS SERIOUS
AS I THOUGHT.

448
00:18:56,533 --> 00:18:58,233
OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE,
HOUSE,

449
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,400
DON'T DO THIS TO YOURSELF.

450
00:18:59,467 --> 00:19:00,533
IT'S A LOFT.

451
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,967
IT HAS NO DEEPER MEANING

452
00:19:02,033 --> 00:19:03,900
THAN OPEN-SPACE
LIVING ARRANGEMENT.

453
00:19:03,967 --> 00:19:05,600
IF YOU BOUGHT
INTO HER DIATRIBE

454
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:08,533
ABOUT REDISCOVERING
HER LOST CITY GIRL ROOTS.

455
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,734
AND TWO BEDROOMS.

456
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,834
IT JUST REEKS
OF COMMITMENT ISSUES.

457
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:14,533
YEAH. OR SHE HAS A BABY.

458
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,033
THIS IS CLASSIC
MID-LIFE CUDDY CRISIS.

459
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,767
THIS IS HER VERSION
OF A TWO-SEAT CONVERTIBLE.

460
00:19:18,834 --> 00:19:21,700
YEAH, CLEARLY YOU'RE FINE
WITH IT.

461
00:19:21,767 --> 00:19:23,734
(Chase)
WILSON, HE'S GOT GLOBAL
LUNG DAMAGE.

462
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,300
MEANS IT'S NOT FUNGAL.
IT'S PCP PNEUMONIA.

463
00:19:31,233 --> 00:19:32,567
HMM.

464
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,300
OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING

465
00:19:35,367 --> 00:19:37,767
IS KNOCKING OUT
HIS IMMUNE SYSTEM.

466
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:42,000
THREE OPTIONS.
HIV. ACQUIRED SCID.

467
00:19:42,066 --> 00:19:45,233
OR MY PERSONAL FAVORITE,
CANCER.

468
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,700
I'M SURE YOU'LL TEST
FOR ALL THREE.

469
00:19:56,266 --> 00:19:58,367
62-YEAR-OLD
AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN

470
00:19:58,433 --> 00:20:00,367
WITH LYMPHOMA
NOW IN REMISSION.

471
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:02,367
I DID A CT AND FOUND
A SMALL LESION

472
00:20:02,433 --> 00:20:04,367
ON THE UPPER LOBE
OF HIS LEFT LUNG.

473
00:20:04,433 --> 00:20:05,967
IF HE'S IN REMISSION,

474
00:20:06,033 --> 00:20:07,100
WHY DID YOU BOTHER
SCANNING HIM?

475
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,500
DURING A ROUTINE FOLLOW-UP,

476
00:20:08,567 --> 00:20:10,367
I REALIZED THE PATIENT
WAS DEPRESSED.

477
00:20:10,433 --> 00:20:13,066
WOW.
THAT'S QUITE A CALL.

478
00:20:13,133 --> 00:20:16,000
THANKS.
THE TREATMENT INDICATE--

479
00:20:16,066 --> 00:20:17,500
[door opens]

480
00:20:17,567 --> 00:20:19,233
OH, I'M SORRY.

481
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,100
I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU WERE
IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING.

482
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,767
IT'S A CONFERENCE ROOM

483
00:20:23,834 --> 00:20:25,533
WITH GLASS WALLS.

484
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,300
YOU THOUGHT I'D BE ALONE?

485
00:20:27,367 --> 00:20:28,900
YOUR PATIENT HAS CANCER.

486
00:20:28,967 --> 00:20:30,967
NOT THAT GUY.

487
00:20:31,033 --> 00:20:32,800
HE PROBABLY ALSO
HAS CANCER.

488
00:20:32,867 --> 00:20:34,100
AND HE'S PROBABLY ALSO
YOUR BUDDY.

489
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,934
THOUGHT YOU'D WANT
TO KNOW.

490
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,100
'CAUSE YOU OWE ME
100 BUCKS.

491
00:20:42,767 --> 00:20:44,200
LYMPHOBLASTIC LEUKEMIA.

492
00:20:44,266 --> 00:20:45,433
A.L.L.

493
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,734
SO IT IS
A RECURRENCE.

494
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,133
NO. IT'S DIFFERENT.
IT'S A SECOND LEUKEMIA.

495
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,800
PROBABLY CAUSED
BY THE CHEMOTHERAPY

496
00:20:54,867 --> 00:20:56,166
WE GAVE HIM
FIVE YEARS AGO.

497
00:20:56,233 --> 00:20:58,000
THAT'S WHY YOU DIDN'T
SEE IT.

498
00:20:58,066 --> 00:21:00,333
MAYBE THEY CAN RENAME IT
IRONIC LEUKEMIA.

499
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,867
THIS IS NOT THE END.

500
00:21:01,934 --> 00:21:04,266
TESTS SHOW THAT THE CANCER
IS LIMITED TO YOUR BRAIN.

501
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:05,533
THAT'S GOOD NEWS.

502
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,266
HOW CAN CANCER IN HIS HEAD
BE GOOD NEWS?

503
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,934
THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER
SEPARATES

504
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
THE BLOOD IN YOUR HEAD
FROM THE BLOOD IN YOUR BODY.

505
00:21:13,066 --> 00:21:14,567
KEEPS THE CANCER
BOTTLED UP.

506
00:21:14,633 --> 00:21:16,900
WE CAN GO FOR A CURE.

507
00:21:16,967 --> 00:21:18,500
SO GIVE ME THE NUMBERS.
WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT?

508
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:19,900
90% CHANCE OF CURE.

509
00:21:19,967 --> 00:21:22,033
REALLY?

510
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,600
WHAT IF WE'RE IN THE 10%?

511
00:21:23,667 --> 00:21:25,000
STEADY DECLINE.

512
00:21:25,066 --> 00:21:27,200
BUT SIX MONTHS
OF A GOOD QUALITY LIFE.

513
00:21:27,266 --> 00:21:28,600
(Emily)
DOES HE HAVE TO GO THROUGH

514
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:30,567
ANOTHER BONE MARROW
TRANSPLANT?
NO.

515
00:21:30,633 --> 00:21:31,767
CHEMOTHERAPY.

516
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:32,867
WE CAN GO AT THIS
WITH DRUGS ALONE.

517
00:21:32,934 --> 00:21:35,667
WHEN DO WE GET STARTED?

518
00:21:35,734 --> 00:21:37,533
WE BEGIN BY SURGICALLY
PLANTING A SHUNT

519
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,333
SO WE CAN GET THE DRUGS
DIRECTLY INTO YOUR BRAIN.

520
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,667
I ALREADY BOOKED THE O.R.

521
00:21:40,734 --> 00:21:42,600
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN MAKE CANCER

522
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:44,100
SOUND LIKE GOOD NEWS.

523
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:45,800
WE GET IT OUT OF YOUR HEAD
AND YOU WALK OUT OF HERE

524
00:21:45,867 --> 00:21:47,066
PARALYSIS GONE
AND CANCER-FREE.

525
00:21:51,266 --> 00:21:53,800
WE ALSO NEED YOU TO SIGN
A HEALTH CARE PROXY.

526
00:21:53,867 --> 00:21:55,734
IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG
IN SURGERY,

527
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,033
SOMEONE NEEDS TO BE APPOINTED
TO MAKE DECISIONS FOR YOU.

528
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,467
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES
OF THAT HAPPENING?

529
00:21:59,533 --> 00:22:00,934
VERY REMOTE.

530
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,133
I THINK MAYBE MELISSA
SHOULD BE MY PROXY.

531
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,667
WHAT?
NO.

532
00:22:04,734 --> 00:22:06,967
(Foreman)
COMING THROUGH.
HOUSE GOT A NEW CASE.

533
00:22:08,934 --> 00:22:12,400
REVISED O.R. SCHEDULE.
SORRY, WILSON, HAD TO BUMP YOU.

534
00:22:12,467 --> 00:22:14,433
IT'S NOT LIKE YOUR GUY'S
BLEEDING OUT OF HIS EYES.

535
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,333
HOUSE, YOUR GUY'S NOT BLEEDING
OUT OF HIS EYES EITHER.

536
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,033
THE NURSE WHO BOOKS THE O.R.
THINKS HE IS.

537
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,266
YOUR CASE IS NO MORE URGENT
THAN MINE.

538
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:21,800
YEAH, BUT YOU'RE WAY
MORE PATIENT.

539
00:22:23,066 --> 00:22:24,166
IT'S OKAY.

540
00:22:24,233 --> 00:22:26,367
YOU CAN TALK
ABOUT THE--THE PAPERWORK

541
00:22:26,433 --> 00:22:28,533
IN THE PREP AREA.

542
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:32,934
YOU TRUST HER MORE
THAN ME.

543
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,266
ABOUT THIS, YES.
[clears throat]

544
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:36,767
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH
THE GOOD STUFF,

545
00:22:36,834 --> 00:22:39,000
BUT MELISSA'S BEEN
TO HELL AND BACK WITH ME.

546
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:42,033
SHE GIVES ME THE BEST SHOT
OF GETTING THROUGH THIS.

547
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,567
YOU STILL LOVE HER.
DON'T BE SILLY.

548
00:22:45,633 --> 00:22:47,500
I LOVE YOU.

549
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:49,266
PLEASE...

550
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:51,233
DON'T MAKE THIS
INTO MORE THAN IT IS.

551
00:22:58,033 --> 00:23:01,467
OKAY, ANYTHING?
NO.

552
00:23:01,533 --> 00:23:04,000
CAN YOU FEEL THIS?
NO.

553
00:23:04,066 --> 00:23:06,667
HOW ABOUT HERE?
NO.

554
00:23:06,734 --> 00:23:09,734
WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

555
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,633
MELISSA AND EMILY
WENT DOWNSTAIRS

556
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,967
TO GET SOME BREAKFAST.
ASHLEY?

557
00:23:13,033 --> 00:23:14,867
SHE HAD WORK TO DO.

558
00:23:14,934 --> 00:23:16,400
I THOUGHT SHE WAS OFF TODAY.

559
00:23:16,467 --> 00:23:18,100
WELL, SHE DIDN'T REALLY
HAVE WORK TO DO.

560
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:19,166
SHE WAS JUST PISSED

561
00:23:19,233 --> 00:23:20,700
SO SHE PRETENDED
TO HAVE WORK TO DO.

562
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:22,300
I LET HER PRETEND.

563
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:25,867
OKAY.

564
00:23:25,934 --> 00:23:27,767
MOVE YOUR FINGERS.

565
00:23:34,567 --> 00:23:35,734
THE CHEMO'S NOT WORKING.

566
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,934
DOES THAT MEAN
IT'S NOT CANCER?

567
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,166
NO. IT MEANS THE CHEMO

568
00:23:40,233 --> 00:23:41,533
FROM YOUR FIRST ROUND
OF TREATMENT

569
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,266
HAS MADE THE LEUKEMIA
RESISTANT.

570
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:46,667
SO I'M IN THE 10%
THAT DON'T GET CURED.

571
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,000
MAYBE NOT.

572
00:23:53,066 --> 00:23:55,834
WE JUST REMOVED A SCREW
FROM A GUY'S LUNG.

573
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,500
AND THE WEIRD THING IS
HE DIDN'T GET BETTER.

574
00:23:58,567 --> 00:23:59,767
ANY IDEA WHAT THAT MEANS?

575
00:23:59,834 --> 00:24:01,567
IT MEANS
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME.

576
00:24:01,633 --> 00:24:03,367
NO. IT MEANS I'M IGNORING YOU
TO MAKE A POINT.

577
00:24:03,433 --> 00:24:04,467
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE.

578
00:24:04,533 --> 00:24:05,800
THE PROBLEM
WITH THAT TECHNIQUE

579
00:24:05,867 --> 00:24:07,533
IS I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT POINT YOU'RE MAKING.

580
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,633
THAT YOUR IDEA IS IMPLICITLY
NOT WORTH RESPONDING TO.

581
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,033
DOUBLING YOUR PATIENT'S
CHEMO DOSE IS STUPID.

582
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,667
DAMN. NOW IT'S EXPLICIT.

583
00:24:15,734 --> 00:24:17,033
IT COULD SWAMP OUT
THE RESISTANCE

584
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,300
OF THE CANCER CELLS.

585
00:24:18,367 --> 00:24:19,867
THE FACT THAT IT
THEORETICALLY SHOULD WORK

586
00:24:19,934 --> 00:24:21,266
DOESN'T MAKE IT
ANY LESS STUPID.

587
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:23,567
OF COURSE IT DOES.
IT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU WOULD DO.

588
00:24:23,633 --> 00:24:25,500
I'M ME. YOU'RE YOU.

589
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,567
AND A TABLE IS A TABLE.

590
00:24:30,633 --> 00:24:32,767
AND CHEMO IS POISON.

591
00:24:32,834 --> 00:24:35,233
AND DOUBLE CHEMO
IS DOUBLE POISON.

592
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,467
I CAN HANDLE IT
WHEN THINGS GO WRONG.

593
00:24:37,533 --> 00:24:39,700
YOU CAN'T.

594
00:24:39,767 --> 00:24:42,000
AND THINGS COULD GO VERY,
VERY WRONG.

595
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,066
I CAN HANDLE IT.

596
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,200
SOUNDS PRETTY DANGEROUS.

597
00:24:55,266 --> 00:24:58,367
IT IS.

598
00:24:58,433 --> 00:24:59,467
WHAT DO YOU THINK, MEL?

599
00:25:03,367 --> 00:25:04,667
I THINK
YOU SHOULD CALL ASHLEY.

600
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,033
YOU'RE MY FAMILY.

601
00:25:10,533 --> 00:25:12,567
I'M SORRY I FORGOT THAT.

602
00:25:16,467 --> 00:25:18,967
I THINK
THAT YOU SHOULD TRY

603
00:25:19,033 --> 00:25:20,800
WHATEVER COULD KEEP YOU
WITH US LONGER.

604
00:25:22,533 --> 00:25:24,767
YEAH.

605
00:25:46,266 --> 00:25:51,800
[chattering and laughter]

606
00:25:51,867 --> 00:25:53,500
LOOK.

607
00:25:53,567 --> 00:25:54,734
I CAN MOVE THEM.

608
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,500
HEY!
THANK YOU.
[laughs]

609
00:25:57,567 --> 00:25:59,734
WHAT IS IT, JIM?

610
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,433
I'M GONNA NEED TO RUN
SOME TESTS.

611
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,367
INTRAEPIDERMAL
SUPERFICIAL BULLAE.

612
00:26:07,433 --> 00:26:09,266
COULD BE PEMPHIGUS.
OR IT COULD BE
FROM THE FIRE.

613
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:11,233
EITHER WAY, HE'S DEAD.

614
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,333
WE CAN'T STOP
THE OOZING.

615
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,367
DON'T CARE.

616
00:26:16,433 --> 00:26:19,567
I'M HERE BECAUSE IT'S 1:15

617
00:26:19,633 --> 00:26:21,900
AND WILSON STARTED TESTING
AT 12:45.

618
00:26:21,967 --> 00:26:25,667
WHICH MEANS...
THE CANCER'S GONE.

619
00:26:25,734 --> 00:26:27,467
BUT OVER HALF HIS HEPATOCYTES
ARE DEAD.

620
00:26:27,533 --> 00:26:30,734
IN ONLY 24 HOURS?

621
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:34,166
HE NEEDS A NEW LIVER.

622
00:26:36,934 --> 00:26:39,467
LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE.

623
00:26:39,533 --> 00:26:42,200
YOU CAN PUBLISH THE RESULTS
OF THIS CASE STUDY.

624
00:26:42,266 --> 00:26:44,233
NO ONE WILL EVER DOUBLE
THE DOSE AGAIN.

625
00:26:47,734 --> 00:26:49,567
GOT RID OF YOUR CANCER.

626
00:26:49,633 --> 00:26:53,400
BUT IT ALSO TRASHED
YOUR LIVER.

627
00:26:53,467 --> 00:26:56,500
IF I DON'T FIND YOU
A NEW LIVER,

628
00:26:56,567 --> 00:26:58,934
YOU'VE ONLY GOT
ABOUT 24 HOURS LEFT.

629
00:27:00,867 --> 00:27:03,100
SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

630
00:27:03,166 --> 00:27:06,300
YOUR FATHER'S BEEN MOVED
TO THE TOP

631
00:27:06,367 --> 00:27:07,934
OF THE TRANSPLANT LIST.

632
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,834
BUT ALL WE REALLY
CAN DO IS WAIT.

633
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,967
THAT'S IT? WE WAIT?

634
00:27:12,033 --> 00:27:13,033
TELL ME SOMETHING
THAT I CAN DO.

635
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,600
I'M SORRY, MEL.

636
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:16,834
YOU AND EMILY DON'T MATCH
TUCK'S BLOOD TYPE.

637
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,433
AND NEITHER DOES ASHLEY.

638
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,300
SO A LIVE LIVER DONATION
IS OUT.

639
00:27:22,367 --> 00:27:26,233
THE BEST THING TO DO
IS JUST WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING.

640
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:29,166
BE TOGETHER.

641
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:35,133
HOPE HE ALREADY TOLD YOU
THAT YOU'RE GONNA DIE.

642
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,367
'CAUSE IT'S GONNA MAKE

643
00:27:36,433 --> 00:27:38,734
WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY
A LOT MORE RELEVANT.

644
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,633
HOUSE, I KNOW IT'S RAINING
OUT THERE IN THE HALLWAY,

645
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:44,100
BUT--
I WAS JUST IN THE ER
TESTING MY PATIENT

646
00:27:44,166 --> 00:27:45,567
FOR AUTONOMIC DYSFUNCTION.

647
00:27:45,633 --> 00:27:47,600
IT'S THE ONLY DEPARTMENT
WITH A SHOWER BIG ENOUGH

648
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:49,433
FOR THE WHOLE TEAM,
PLUS THE CARDIAC MONITORS,

649
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,000
PLUS ME.

650
00:27:51,066 --> 00:27:52,467
ANYWAY, RELEVANT PART,

651
00:27:52,533 --> 00:27:53,734
WE'RE JUST WHEELING
THE GUY OUT,

652
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,000
TRAUMA CAME IN.

653
00:27:55,066 --> 00:27:56,367
MOTORCYCLE VERSUS SEMI.

654
00:27:56,433 --> 00:27:58,533
HOW BAD?
BAD FOR THE MOTORCYCLE.

655
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,834
GOOD FOR YOUR LIVER.

656
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:00,867
BLOOD TYPE'S A MATCH.

657
00:28:00,934 --> 00:28:01,867
WHY WASN'T I PAGED?

658
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,767
BECAUSE THERE'S A PROBLEM.

659
00:28:03,834 --> 00:28:05,200
NO ORGAN DONOR CARD.

660
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:06,800
DEAD GUY'S SISTER
IS NEXT OF KIN.

661
00:28:06,867 --> 00:28:08,600
SHE'S REFUSING TO ALLOW
THE DONATION.

662
00:28:08,667 --> 00:28:10,700
WHERE IS SHE?
20 MINUTES AWAY.

663
00:28:14,133 --> 00:28:16,500
HOW DO YOU GET THE CALL
THAT YOUR BROTHER'S DEAD

664
00:28:16,567 --> 00:28:17,934
AND THEN RUN OUT THE DOOR?

665
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,767
"OH--OH--OH,
THAT REMINDS ME,

666
00:28:19,834 --> 00:28:23,200
I-I HAD DRY CLEANING
TO PICK UP."

667
00:28:23,266 --> 00:28:25,066
DID CUDDY BUY THE PLACE?

668
00:28:25,133 --> 00:28:28,200
NOT YET. YOU OKAY?

669
00:28:28,266 --> 00:28:30,533
JUST MAKING CONVERSATION.

670
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,834
YOURS WAS GETTING BORING.

671
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,533
WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING?

672
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,800
I'M NOT PLANNING ANYTHING.

673
00:28:34,867 --> 00:28:36,200
AND I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

674
00:28:36,266 --> 00:28:37,834
HOW ARE YOU GONNA PUNISH HER
FOR DATING LUCAS?

675
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:41,166
OKAY, NOW THIS CONVERSATION
IS GETTING BORING.

676
00:28:43,066 --> 00:28:45,700
ARE YOU REALLY OKAY?
NO!

677
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:48,633
I AM NOT OKAY.
NOT EVEN CLOSE.

678
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:54,400
WOW. OKAY.
SEE, THAT'S VERY ADULT OF YOU.

679
00:28:54,467 --> 00:28:55,500
NO, IT ISN'T.

680
00:28:56,867 --> 00:28:58,133
IT'S JUST ME ACCEPTING
THE FACT

681
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,066
THAT THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO
AND MOVING ON.

682
00:29:00,133 --> 00:29:03,166
WHICH IS, I THINK,
THE DEFINITION OF ADULTHOOD.

683
00:29:03,233 --> 00:29:05,500
WELL, IF IT IS,
BEING A KID IS A LOT MORE FUN.

684
00:29:07,266 --> 00:29:08,400
SHOWTIME.

685
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,667
I DIDN'T SPEAK TO HIM
FOR YEARS.

686
00:29:19,734 --> 00:29:22,300
BUT WHEN MY PARENTS DIED,

687
00:29:22,367 --> 00:29:24,000
AT THEIR FUNERAL,

688
00:29:24,066 --> 00:29:27,233
WE MADE PEACE.

689
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,300
OUR PARENTS
MUST'VE BLESSED IT.

690
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:33,000
AND I'M SURE THEY WOULD
WANT HIM TO DO GOOD

691
00:29:33,066 --> 00:29:34,567
WITH HIS LAST ACT
IN THIS WORLD.

692
00:29:34,633 --> 00:29:38,066
THEY WANTED US
TO BE FRIENDS.

693
00:29:38,133 --> 00:29:39,900
OUR RELATIONSHIP
WASN'T STRONG,

AN IDIOT.

DOING THE RIGHT THING.

LIVING ACT

WAS TO DONATE A PART
OF HIS LIVER?

CONSIDERING THIS?

WHY SHOULDN'T I DO EVERYTHING
I CAN TO HELP THEM?

NOT A DONOR.

868
00:40:51,934 --> 00:40:54,300
YOU DON'T FEEL ANGRY?

869
00:40:54,367 --> 00:40:57,934
AH. I'M A LITTLE
DISAPPOINTED.

870
00:41:00,066 --> 00:41:03,533
DISAPPOINTMENT IS ANGER
FOR WIMPS.

871
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:07,100
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE SO GENTLE
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

872
00:41:07,166 --> 00:41:11,266
IT'S OKAY TO GET ANGRY
ONCE IN A WHILE.

873
00:41:11,333 --> 00:41:13,467
YOU CAN'T CHANGE
A TABLE.

874
00:41:13,533 --> 00:41:16,200
ACTUALLY, YOU CAN.

875
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:19,467
JUST NEED A COAT OF PAINT
AND THE GUTS TO USE IT.

876
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:39,900
BONNIE.

877
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,433
BONNIE TOLD ME
WHAT CUDDY BID.

878
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,333
YOU'RE GONNA OUTBID HER?

879
00:42:13,934 --> 00:42:15,533
WE DO NEED A BIGGER
REFRIGERATOR.

880
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:22,133
SHE HURT MY FRIEND.
SHE SHOULD BE PUNISHED.

881
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,700
YOU GOT MAD.

882
00:42:25,767 --> 00:42:28,400
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

883
00:42:28,467 --> 00:42:29,734
CUDDY WON'T SHARE
THAT SENTIMENT.

884
00:42:31,166 --> 00:42:33,066
HOW ARE YOU GOING
TO EXPLAIN IT TO HER?

885
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:35,567
I'M CHANGING OUR ADDRESS
TO A P.O. BOX.

886
00:42:35,633 --> 00:42:37,600
SHE'LL FIND OUT
EVENTUALLY.

887
00:42:37,667 --> 00:42:40,633
A PROBLEM DELAYED

888
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,834
IS A PROBLEM DENIED.

889
00:42:45,166 --> 00:42:48,934
BONNIE. I'LL TAKE IT.

890
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,867
BABY STEPS.
