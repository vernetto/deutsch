1
00:00:05,605 --> 00:00:09,735
Where are those projections?
Three, six and nine
are in their folders.

2
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:12,277
Can I have some more--
Excellent.
Tea's at your seat. Hello.

3
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:15,246
Oh, hold on.

4
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:18,113
Ben Federman again,
another pre-call.

5
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:22,780
We did the pre-call.
Is this the post pre-call call?

6
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,381
The board's gonna want specifics
with the push into the Asian markets.

7
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:27,392
Ben, there are no specifics
about Asia.

8
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,985
We came up with that
as a Hail Mary at 3:00 in the morning...

9
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:32,054
to placate the board
about international.

10
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:34,191
Carly, I'm just giving you
a heads-up about Asia.

11
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,469
There is no Asia.

12
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:40,872
Let's talk about Asia.

13
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:45,138
We're in the preliminary stages
of forming a strategic alliance
with Credit Lyonnais.

14
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:49,477
Within three months,
you won't be able to walk four feet
in Kangham, South Korea...

15
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,483
without seeing
one of our beautiful models...

16
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:55,783
smiling at you from billboards
and drugstore windows,
inviting you in.

17
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:59,484
That's incredible news, Carly.
We'd hoped to hear
something about Asia.

18
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,153
Had no idea
plans were so far along.

19
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,992
Well, you know Asia.
Nothing's done until it's done.

20
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,592
Carly, I was wondering,

21
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:11,159
could you walk us through
what you were thinking
for other Asian territories?

22
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:14,638
Absolutely. India has over
half a billion women.

23
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:18,609
In terms of spending power,
it's the single largest potential market
in the world.

24
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:32,287
Um, we have retained a local firm
to ensure that cultural differences
are respected.

25
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:36,351
Um, however, I can't
go into the specifics of my plan
with you until tomorrow.

26
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:38,363
Right now I have a meeting
and I need the room.

27
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,763
We were just getting started.

28
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:44,031
I know and I do apologize.
It's last minute,

29
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:47,596
but the meeting is with
three state department officials
to smooth the way for China.

30
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:51,041
China?
This is just incredible.

31
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,545
- We'll be in touch.
- Thank you.

32
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:57,146
What is it?
I need a doctor.

33
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,811
I can't move my leg.

34
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:41,456
32-year-old female, paralysis
and severe pain in her right quad. Go.

35
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:45,897
- How'd she get to you?
- She's the C.E.O. of Sonyo Cosmetics.

36
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:49,332
Three assistants and 15 V.P.'s
checked out who should be treating her.

37
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:52,428
Who da man? I da man.
I always suspected.

38
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,997
Dr. House, I know
the chances are very slim,
but I'm sure you recognize...

39
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:59,203
that she may have what you had,
a clot in her thigh.

40
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,338
A bit of a long shot.

41
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:04,440
- What about a disk herniation?
- I don't know, Eric.

42
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:07,782
If her disk were herniated,
she'd present with pain elsewhere,
wouldn't she?

43
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,013
- Yeah, I suppose.
- You're right.

44
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,957
A clot's also the most deadly,
right, Robert?

45
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:18,827
True. The clot breaks off,
she could stroke and die.

46
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:20,798
Dr. House,
I believe that they're right--

47
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:24,030
- Stop talking.
- What?

48
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:27,504
You read one of those
negotiating books, didn't you?

49
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:33,171
Getting To Yes.
Fifty Ways to Win an Argument.
Hitchhiker's Guide to Being a Pal.

50
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:37,740
In five seconds,
you just manipulated these two
into agreeing with your point of view.

51
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:40,149
Fellas, this is known
as soft positional bargaining.

52
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,689
It's not gonna work.

53
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:46,224
Dr. House, are you saying
that she doesn't have a clot,

54
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:49,420
or are you saying
that if she does have a clot,

55
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:51,725
she doesn't need blood thinners
and an angiogram?

56
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:57,668
Chase, put her on blood thinners.
Do an angiogram.

57
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,297
When that comes back negative,
M.R.I. the spine.

58
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:03,035
If that's clean,
cut her open and biopsy the leg.

59
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:08,240
Excellent suggestion.
Read less, more TV.

60
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:11,283
It's rare for an individual
to make a donation...

61
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:16,687
significant enough
to impact an organization
as large and unwieldy as a hospital.

62
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:20,283
This donation
does come with one string,

63
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,521
that he be made
chairman of the board.

64
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:26,326
I think that's a reasonable request.
I think he should have the right to know...

65
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:31,268
what it is we do
with his $100 million.

66
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:33,931
Please welcome
our new chairman of the board,
Edward Vogler.

67
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:38,205
Thank you.

68
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,940
Thank you.

69
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:44,381
When I was 18,

70
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,543
my dad loaned me $20,000
for a college tuition,

71
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:52,023
which he would have known was a mistake
had he known I wasn't actually in college.

72
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:57,723
I took his money and invested
in a friend who had a little business.

73
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,732
And when my dad found out
what I had done with his money,

74
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,258
he and I didn't talk much
after that.

75
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:06,271
But my friend's business took off,

76
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:10,935
and I used the profits from that
to buy another company and another.

77
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,604
And I must have been pretty good at it,
had a good eye,

78
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,013
because before I knew it,
people were making offers for my company.

79
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,711
And about a year ago,
I went public,

80
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:23,017
and overnight
I was worth a billion dollars.

81
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:25,523
So, I went to see my dad.

82
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:29,994
I'll admit. I wanted a little payback.
You know, kind of shove
the win in his face.

83
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:33,396
So, I drove upstate,
and sat in the kitchen I grew up in,

84
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:36,902
and, uh, he had no reaction.

85
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:42,899
It wasn't his fault.
He didn't even know who I was,

86
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:46,342
because his Alzheimer's
had taken a turn for the worse,

87
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:49,210
despite the best drugs
and care out there.

88
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,842
And that is why I'm here.

89
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:56,184
What if my contribution to this hospital
is the difference between...

90
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:59,122
no cure and a cure for cancer?

91
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:03,390
The difference between
a man not recognizing
his wife of 35 years...

92
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:08,730
and being able to look at her and say,
"Good morning, honey. I love you."

93
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:13,171
If there's a disease out there
killing people,

94
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:17,141
I am writing you a blank check
to fight back.

95
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:23,178
So, things are going to change a lot.

96
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,825
We're gonna have to ask you
for the cell phone.

97
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,659
Do what you need to do.
I'm okay.

98
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:41,859
I'm pretty sure my X-ray machine
can take your phone in a fight.

99
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:45,927
It'll fry it.

100
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:48,439
Fine.

101
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:53,241
- How old is she?
- Thirty-two.

102
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:56,440
Wow. And she's already
the C.E.O. of a public company.

103
00:06:56,516 --> 00:07:00,213
She's a workaholic.
Okay, Carly, hold still.

104
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,516
The X-ray machine
is gonna pass over your leg.

105
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,250
Okay.
What'd you do with your time off?

106
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:07,383
Snowboarding in Gstaad.

107
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,394
Switzerland.

108
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,293
Do you ski or board?
You can come with if you like.

109
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:15,027
Maybe we should start with a drink
before we go around the world.

110
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:18,264
Oh, you wanna have
a drink with me?

111
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:21,306
Oh, very aggressive.
I like that.

112
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:28,839
I wanna run this place
like a business.

113
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:30,815
What, you want to put
more vending machines
in the hallway?

114
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:33,750
Maybe a roulette wheel?
Nice one.
But I'm serious.

115
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,415
The product that
you're selling is good health.
It shouldn't be a tough sell.

116
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,926
If you don't wanna sell,
it means you don't care
if people get your product.

117
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:44,554
You care if people are healthy,
or are you too proud for that?

118
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,459
Who's that?

119
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:56,937
Oh, that's just
one of our doctors.

120
00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:00,775
Aren't, uh, doctors
supposed to wear lab coats?

121
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:03,179
- He's different.
- Everyone's buddy.

122
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:07,345
- No, not exactly.
- Then why does he get away with it?

123
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:12,255
It's just a coat.
He's very good.

124
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,294
Hmm.

125
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:20,331
- Say "Ah".
- Ah.

126
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:23,800
Now really belt it out,
like you're gonna throw up.
Ahh!

127
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,704
Perfect.

128
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:30,037
Okay, that's it.

129
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:33,601
We should know in a couple of days
what's growing in your son's throat.

130
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:38,509
Hello?

131
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:42,020
- He can't talk.
- Excuse me?

132
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:45,216
- He had knee surgery.
- Right?

133
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,987
About a year ago,
and then he couldn't talk.

134
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,188
Right.
Yeah, well, that happens.

135
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:55,792
You know, it's very dangerous
operating so close to the vocal cords.

136
00:08:55,868 --> 00:09:00,828
Okay. Well, we'll send
your kid's culture to the lab
and somebody will call you.

137
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:03,171
Boo!

138
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:11,709
Just wanted to see if your dad,
you know-- Bizarre.

139
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:17,549
I need you to wear
your lab coat.

140
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:22,526
I need two days of outrageous sex
with someone obscenely younger
than you, like half your age.

141
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:24,722
Wear the coat.

142
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:27,732
Man, oh, man,
someone got spanked
real good this morning.

143
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,530
A guy gives $100 million
to cure cancer.

144
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:33,003
A pretty small concession
to wear a lab coat.

145
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,199
Cure cancer?

146
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:38,266
Is the hospital getting
out of the dull business
of treating patients?

147
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:40,471
You know that's not
what he's doing.
I know exactly what he's doing.

148
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,673
He's using us to run
clinical trials.

149
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:46,184
Oh, shame on him,
saving lives like that.

150
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,119
It's unethical.

151
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:52,316
Oh, are you coming in too?
I thought I had you convinced.

152
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:54,882
Clinical trials
save thousands of lives.

153
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,952
He's using patients as guinea pigs.

154
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:59,691
Pharmaceutical companies
do that every day.

155
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,962
Are we a pharmaceutical company?
We're gonna wind up pressuring
desperate patients...

156
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:05,230
into choices that are
bad for them, good for us.

157
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:08,762
We're gonna compromise
patient care.
Who the hell am I talking to?

158
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:11,207
Suddenly ethical lapses
are a major concern for you?

159
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,769
What's interesting is
it suddenly doesn't bother you.

160
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:20,049
So, if you ignore ethics
to save one person it's admirable,

161
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,280
but if you do it to save
a thousand, you're a bastard.

162
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:25,620
All he's done is taken your game
and gone pro.

163
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,596
He's not gonna kill a few patients.
He's gonna kill this hospital.

164
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:34,861
It took him three seconds
to size you up.

165
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:37,732
And surprise,
he doesn't like you.

166
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,931
Wear the damn coat.

167
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:51,410
Hello. I'm, uh, Dr. Foreman.
I work with Dr. House.

168
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,418
Our initial tests say you're fine.

169
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,580
We think you had a clot,
but it resolved on its own.

170
00:10:56,656 --> 00:11:00,183
So, we're gonna keep you
overnight to be safe,
and you can go back home tomorrow...

171
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,784
or back to work.

172
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:06,491
Hey, are you okay?

173
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:13,828
Get in here!
I need a line in her.
I.V. morphine, stat!

174
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,351
You get any read
on the new chairman of the board?

175
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,685
- Yeah, he took your parking space.
- It's not necessarily bad news.

176
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:32,951
Do you ever watch
Gilligan's Island reruns...

177
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,926
and really, really think
they're gonna get off
the island this time?

178
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,098
We should introduce ourselves.
It couldn't hurt.

179
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:45,468
Make him a Bundt cake.
A patient hit a 10 on the pain scale.
What would explain that?

180
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,631
There was no clot in her leg.
The angio was totally clean.

181
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,402
What about the muscle biopsy?

182
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:51,705
No neurogenic
or myopathic abnormalities.

183
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:56,612
She was also negative for trichinosis.
No toxoplasmosis
or polyarteritis nodosa.

184
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:59,082
Robert, what was
her sedimentation rate?

185
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,153
Normal, Allison.

186
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:05,054
Therefore, no inflammation,
no immunologic response.

187
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:07,718
Do you mind sharing
that number with me?

188
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:09,784
Fifteen, Allison.

189
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:13,127
- Are you mocking me?
- Duh, Allison.

190
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:17,226
I'm just suggesting
we look outside the box.
What if her sed rate is elevated?

191
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:21,399
Well, let's go further outside the box.
Let's say the angio revealed a clot.

192
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,772
And then let's say
we treated that clot,

193
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:25,936
and now she's all better
and personally thanked me
by performing--

194
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:27,911
My Aunt Elyssa
lives in Philadelphia.

195
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,916
Oh, it's story time.
Let me get my "baba".

196
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:36,080
Her normal temperature is 96.2,
not 98.6 like you and me.

197
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:38,521
If her temperature were 98.6,
she'd have a fever.

198
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:44,587
I'm just wondering if you think
we could apply the same logic
to Carly's sed rate.

199
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:48,925
It's absurd.

200
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:51,526
I love it.

201
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,300
If 15 is high for Carly,
then she has inflammation.

202
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:57,672
Which could, in turn, mean cancer.
I'll talk to Wilson.

203
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:01,840
Next time, skip Aunt Elyssa.

204
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:04,382
You're probably talking about
a primary bone cancer.

205
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,714
It could be tricky to detect.
We'll need a bone scan.

206
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,947
That's why I'm talking
to an oncologist.

207
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:14,015
Sure. I've nothing better to do
besides departmental meetings
and budget reports.

208
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:17,688
New chairman of the board,
you know.
Oh, I hadn't heard.

209
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:20,630
Right. Clinical trials.
Completely unethical.

210
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:24,965
And a very bad omen for you.
There's not much money in curing
African sleeping sickness.

211
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:28,131
No. I have seen
every scary movie ever made.

212
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:30,266
Six-year-old twins
in front of an elevator of blood.

213
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:32,572
Boys' choirs.
Those are bad omens.

214
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:36,741
This is much more mundane.
A billionaire wants to get laid.

215
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,046
Billionaires buy movie studios
to get laid.

216
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:41,052
They buy hospitals
to get respect.

217
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,248
And the reason you want respect?
To get laid.

218
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,655
Okay then.
Just gotta think like a billionaire.

219
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:49,387
Let's see.
There'll be big,
scary changes and then,

220
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:54,558
"Oh, Dr. Cameron, we should have dinner
to discuss your future on my G5 private jet."

221
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:56,931
Come on. You know
how good you have it here.

222
00:13:57,002 --> 00:14:00,301
Yes, I'm the big poobah,
the big cheese, the go-to guy.

223
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:02,772
You do the cases you wanna do
when you wanna do them.

224
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,367
You're not gonna have that
anywhere else.
Relax.

225
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:08,038
I've been through
three regime changes in this hospital.
Every time same story.

226
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:10,673
Just keep your head down.
That's all I'm saying.

227
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:14,241
And put on your coat.
It itches.

228
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,778
So, you gonna do this bone scan
for me, or what?

229
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,018
Yes.

230
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:35,905
Dr. Simpson, did you hear?
New management.

231
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:38,375
I'm thinking of switching
to orthopedics.

232
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:42,437
How much do you guys
get for a massage now?
Without the happy ending.

233
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:46,041
Dr. House, what do you want?
Do you remember a guy
named Van Der Meer?

234
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:48,450
Not a big talker.
You fixed his A.C.L.

235
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,488
No, not according
to my medical malpractice premiums.

236
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,685
Didn't get hypotensive
during surgery?

237
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,558
No strokes?
Maybe some connectivity loss?

238
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,360
What, you're gonna
get involved now?
I'm not involved.

239
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:03,663
A guy brought his son
into the clinic.
I didn't touch the son.

240
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,398
I'm not taking
any responsibility there.
The son's fine. Can't shut him up.

241
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:10,169
Dad show any symptoms
of cortical disease? Wernicke's?

242
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,042
No. Nothing.

243
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:17,048
That's why we settled
because we couldn't find anything.

244
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:19,346
The guy got over a million dollars.
Don't tell me he's complaining.

245
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,909
He's not saying boo.

246
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,321
Your father wants to know
when you'll be back from your trip.

247
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:31,761
E-mail back
it's taking longer than I thought.

248
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,697
He doesn't need to
see me like this.
What about your brother?

249
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:38,703
- No.
- Hello. I'm Dr. Wilson. I was--

250
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,137
- Um, Robin, I'm gonna need a minute.
- Oh.

251
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,870
Thank you.

252
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:54,050
There are two Dr. Wilsons
in this hospital,

253
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,849
one in ophthalmology
and one in cancer.

254
00:15:56,922 --> 00:16:01,950
My eyes are fine,
so I'm guessing you're here
to tell me that I have cancer.

255
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,689
There is no cancer in your bone.

256
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:06,697
You're not smiling.

257
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:11,696
There's something called referred pain.
You could have cancer
in one part of your body...

258
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:14,034
that presents in another.

259
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:17,075
Given your age
and your family history,
I'm thinking your colon.

260
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,235
Great.

261
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:25,843
I was at Columbia
when my mom died.
Now there's a blast.

262
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:28,682
Cleaning up her vomit,
and then running to my econ final.

263
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,881
Look.

264
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:33,823
If I'm a short-timer, give me drugs.
I'll go back to work. I'll die there.

265
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:37,988
Whoa. There's a very quick test
to see if you even have it--
a colonoscopy.

266
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:41,157
I know how you do that test.

267
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:44,896
If you have colon cancer,
we can treat it. It's early.

268
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:48,497
That's what they told my mom.
She was dead six months later.

269
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:55,172
You're a smart person
about to make a very bad decision.

270
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:58,341
You know, cancer treatment's
come a long way in 12 years,
but if you don't do this now--

271
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:00,851
I don't wanna be looked at.

272
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:13,124
There is another way.

273
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,632
We could do a virtual colonoscopy.

274
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:20,229
Basically, we do a C. T. scan
of your colon. It's noninvasive.

275
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:23,433
But it's very expensive.
I'm assuming that's not a problem.

276
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,314
Say yes.

277
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:35,920
Dr. Becker--

278
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:39,688
Mr. Van Der Meer.

279
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:41,953
What?

280
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:49,326
Relax.
Ricky's gonna be just "finkf".
Strep throat.

281
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:52,893
Here's a prescription
for an antibiotic. He should
be all better in a few days.

282
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:56,930
Although,
this might sting a little.

283
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:13,086
I wanna see you again
real soon.

284
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,026
Virtual colonoscopy was clean.

285
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,155
No colon cancer.

286
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:21,358
What happened to our regular,
old-fashioned colonoscopy?

287
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:25,335
She was uncomfortable
doing any more tests.
I had to convince her to do that one.

288
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:29,465
Do you get that often?
Women would rather die
than get naked with you?

289
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,805
She's scared.

290
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:37,042
But not of tests.
Just embarrassing ones.

291
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,845
Yeah.

292
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:47,687
It's not an inflammatory process.
It's not a clot, because Chase's
angio says so.

293
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,389
And it's not cancer,
because her tush is perfect.

294
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:56,298
Anybody else got an Aunt Elyssa
with weird stuff?

295
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:00,735
Maybe it's worth looking into--

296
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,036
I thought you said
Carly's angio was clean.

297
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:06,544
It was clean.

298
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:15,886
You guys see
the problem here?

299
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:21,184
There's no indication
of any abnormalities.

300
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,194
No lesions,
no spurs, no mastis--

301
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:27,756
Her toes are screwed up.
They're backwards.

302
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:31,166
You guys know how much surgery
it's gonna take to swap 'em back?

303
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:32,999
What are you talking about?

304
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:37,201
Well, either she literally
has two left feet,
or you angioed the wrong leg.

305
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,011
That's impossible.
It can't be--
Or maybe it was Jenny.

306
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:51,044
How come some resident
signed this radiology report?
Were you even in the room?

307
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:53,182
- I'll redo her angio--
- You'll do nothing!

308
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:01,224
Foreman,
you do the angiogram.

309
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,479
I can't believe I did that.

310
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,877
Why do we have to
redo the angiogram?

311
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:26,391
There was a shadow
on the first test result.
Shadow?

312
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:29,718
A shadow means
there could be a blood clot, right?

313
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:34,422
I read Conn's Current Therapy.

314
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:38,299
A real page-turner.
No, it wasn't that kind of shadow.

315
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:44,105
My chest hurts.
It's from the tracer I injected.

316
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:49,011
You might also get a little nauseous
or have a metallic taste.
All normal.

317
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:52,141
I'm a runner.
I shouldn't feel like this.

318
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:54,515
Carly, I'm looking
at your vitals right now and--

319
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,577
I can't breathe.
Carly?

320
00:20:58,357 --> 00:20:59,984
My chest.

321
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,296
My chest.

322
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:10,998
Respiratory arrest.
Call code.

323
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:13,299
- What do you got?
- She's drowning.

324
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:34,092
Foreman did a thoracentesis
to drain the fluid from her lungs.

325
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,686
She's stable.
They sent the fluid to the lab.
It'll be back in a few hours.

326
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:42,495
You'll be happy to know
Chase's mistake didn't cost her.
Angio revealed no clot.

327
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,736
I'm thrilled.

328
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,938
Okay, see, now you're just
being stubborn.

329
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:36,674
It's cold.
It's a perfectly good excuse
to wear your lab coat.

330
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,682
Carly needs a heart transplant.

331
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,713
Thoracentesis revealed
a transudate?

332
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,949
I haven't gotten it back yet.

333
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:48,288
Her MUGA scan,
what was the ejection fraction?

334
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,126
Maybe you could treat it surgically.
I haven't done the MUGA.

335
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:54,495
How do you know
she needs a heart transplant?

336
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,534
I got my aura read today.

337
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:00,070
It said someone close to me
had a broken heart.

338
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:02,572
Since when do I need
the secret pass code to talk to you?

339
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:06,008
I can't tell you anything.
Professional responsibility.

340
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:08,136
Like that matters to you.

341
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:11,182
Not my professional
responsibility, yours.

342
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:13,774
New regime.
You gotta keep
your head down too.

343
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:16,412
Now that's good thinking,
because I was gonna go
right to Cuddy...

344
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:18,422
and rat you out
as soon as you were done talking.

345
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,822
I'm not saying you want to.
I'm saying you'd be obligated to.

346
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:23,326
Because of my position
on the board?

347
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,900
Because of my position
on the transplant committee?

348
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:35,238
Hey, you brought this up for a reason.
You need to talk to me.

349
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,673
I can't.

350
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:43,778
You sure you're doing the right thing?

351
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:47,250
I've come up with a few
really great rationalizations.

352
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,254
Sorry to interrupt.
We have a problem.

353
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,517
Thoracentesis revealed a transudate.

354
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:55,856
We did an echo.
She's in severe congestive heart failure.

355
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:59,192
She needs a heart transplant.

356
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,866
- We'll get her on the list immediately.
- She's already on the list.

357
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:12,606
Come in.

358
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:16,843
Thanks.

359
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:19,975
What is a department
of Diagnostic Medicine?

360
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,878
That's Dr. House's department.

361
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:27,413
They deal with cases
that other doctors can't figure out.

362
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:30,620
It's a financial black hole.

363
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,890
The department costs us
three million a year...

364
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:35,455
to treat one patient a week.

365
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,502
He saves one patient per week.
What about everyone else?

366
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:40,003
His department's not going to find
the cure for breast cancer.

367
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:43,438
- Uh, maybe not, but--
- Are you sleeping with House?

368
00:25:43,508 --> 00:25:47,239
What? No.
But you did. Right?

369
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:50,042
A long time ago?

370
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:52,174
That's an incredibly
inappropriate question.

371
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:56,653
If your judgment is compromised
by a prior or current relationship,
that is my business.

372
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:59,189
I respect him.
That is all you need to know.

373
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:01,691
He's still not wearing the coat.

374
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,524
Well, I told him--
I'm sure you did.

375
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:09,192
And yet he's not wearing it.
I'm just wondering if that's
a reflection on him...

376
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:11,292
or on you.

377
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,850
You're Dr. House.

378
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:30,354
I found a picture online
of you at a conference.
You need a heart transplant.

379
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,224
- I run. I work out--
- You cut yourself.

380
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,562
Probably highly ritualized.

381
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:42,157
You play the same Sarah McLachlan song
over and over while you do it.

382
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:44,531
Probably works better
than antidepressants.

383
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:50,073
- I don't understand how that--
- You're a high-powered bulimic.
You make yourself throw up.

384
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:56,478
You had to find the most efficient way
to vomit without revealing
the telltale signs of bulimia,

385
00:26:56,548 --> 00:27:00,143
which is all, ooh,
very unseemly for a C.E.O.

386
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:05,155
So, you found a common antidote
to accidental poisoning to do the job--

387
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:07,157
Ipecac.

388
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:10,353
Which is great if your kid's
just swallowed a bottle of aspirin,

389
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:12,828
but really, really bad
if it's a habit.

390
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:16,066
It causes muscle damage.

391
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:18,295
It caused the pain in your leg.

392
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:23,271
And destroyed your heart.

393
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,401
How often do you do it?

394
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:36,419
Three times a week.

395
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:44,187
In about an hour,
there's gonna be an emergency meeting
of the transplant committee...

396
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:47,959
to discuss where you fall on the list
should a new heart become available.

397
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:52,732
Problem is, I am required
to tell the committee about your bulimia.

398
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:57,969
It's a major psychiatric condition.
Ranks right up there with suicidal.
Makes you a very bad risk.

399
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:02,275
So, you're here to tell me
I have just a few hours to live?

400
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:06,042
Unless I lie to the committee.

401
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:11,318
But if they find out,
I lose my medical license.

402
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:17,189
This would be a very good time
to offer me a bribe.

403
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:19,822
You know, how much is your life worth?
How much is my job worth?

404
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:25,097
Why are you here
doing this to me?
What do you want?

405
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:29,630
I wanna know what's right.

406
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,733
Am I worth it?

407
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:35,412
You think I'm pathetic.

408
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:39,348
Has a goodjob.
Everything in the world.

409
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:42,250
But she just doesn't like
the way that she looks.

410
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,618
Oh, stop hiding!

411
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:47,817
I'm asking you
if you wanna live or die?
You can't even say that.

412
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,759
What do you
want me to do? Cry?
Yes.

413
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:54,287
I want you to tell me
that your life is important to you,
because I don't know.

414
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:04,437
Because that's what's
on the table right now--
your life.

415
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:23,320
I don't wanna die.

416
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:28,632
I don't.

417
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:39,799
This 32-year-old female
was admitted by my staff,

418
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:42,608
because of paralysis
and pain in her right thigh.

419
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:47,379
The patient rapidly deteriorated
and now has severe congestive
heart failure.

420
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:50,421
Pressors and vasodilators
have not improved
her condition whatsoever.

421
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:54,356
Pulmonary function tests
show an F.E.C. of over three liters,

422
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:58,156
with F.E. V.-1
of at least 90% of predicted...

423
00:29:58,229 --> 00:30:02,928
and preserved F.E.D./F.E.C. ratio
and preserved D.L.C.O. as well.

424
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:08,871
Her MUGA had an ejection fraction of 19%
with no focal wall motion abnormalities.

425
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:14,003
Heart catheterization revealed
clean left, right and circumflex arteries.

426
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:18,276
And a subsequent biopsy revealed
irreversible cardiomyopathy.

427
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:20,647
Which is why we're here.

428
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:24,449
Uh, Dr. House, I'm confused
by your time and date stamps.

429
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:28,219
It appears that you put Carly
on the transplant list
before you did these tests.

430
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:33,262
I had a hunch.

431
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,959
You don't have hunches.
You know.

432
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:39,197
Look, if the tests
had come back differently,
obviously I would have taken her off the list.

433
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,204
But on the long shot--

434
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:47,977
On the long shot that I was right,
I didn't want to waste time.

435
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:53,614
Is there any exclusion criteria
we should know about?

436
00:30:55,954 --> 00:31:00,050
CAT scan revealed no tumors,
and Dr. Wilson found no trace of cancer.

437
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:04,492
What about any other criteria?

438
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:07,895
- No atherosclerotic vascular disease.
- Are there any--

439
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:12,665
No pneumonia, no bacteremia.
No hep "B" or "C"
or any other letters.

440
00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:14,830
Substance abuse.
Any history--

441
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:16,840
No alcohol. No drugs.

442
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:21,106
Any psychiatric conditions?
History of depression?
She's a little blue.

443
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:25,115
But turns out
she needs a heart transplant, so--

444
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:35,119
Dr. House, if you subvert
or mislead this committee,

445
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:38,094
you will be subject
to disciplinary action.

446
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:46,534
Dr. Cuddy, do you have reason
to think that I would lie?

447
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:50,165
I simply want you
to answer the question.

448
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:53,642
Is there anything
on the recipient exclusion criteria...

449
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:57,875
that would disqualify your patient
from getting a heart?

450
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:10,958
No.

451
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:21,037
Beautiful organ donor weather.

452
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:23,039
You lied, didn't you?

453
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,507
I never lie.
Big mistake.

454
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:28,443
Then you should have voted
against putting her on the list.

455
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:32,813
- You're my friend.
- Oh, geez, have some backbone.

456
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:34,818
If you think I'm wrong,
do something.

457
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:37,047
Wait. You're getting mad at me
for sticking up for you?

458
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:41,114
You value our friendship
more than your ethical responsibilities.

459
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:43,990
Our friendship
is an ethical responsibility.

460
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,964
What is it?

461
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,870
My patient's getting a heart.

462
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:09,553
He's not gonna fire you.

463
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,986
I'd fire you. Bye-bye.

464
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:17,023
I screw up, the patient dies,
I'll never get another job.

465
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:19,996
So stick your head between your legs
and go lick your wounds in Gstaad.

466
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,357
Well, I like it here.

467
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:32,837
You guys don't think it's weird
House knew the patient needed
a heart transplant...

468
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,878
before we did any heart tests?

469
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,073
That's House.
He knows things.

470
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:40,014
But usually he's putting it
in our face.

471
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:42,211
Telling us how cleverly
he figured it out.

472
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:45,187
This time nothing.
Just had a hunch.

473
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:49,392
That is weird.

474
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:24,091
Cauterize that one bleeder.

475
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,095
Okay, ready for the donor heart.

476
00:34:36,607 --> 00:34:39,940
They just stopped Carly's heart,
and your dumb patient--

477
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:42,946
They're all--
Oh, the guy who can't talk.
Mr. Van Der Meer.

478
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:46,108
He's scheduled an appointment
to see you.
Oh, goody.

479
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:53,185
I wanted you to know
Chase is worried
you're going to fire him.

480
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:56,090
It's bad enough
that screwups cost lives.

481
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,321
Now we've got Vogler,
screwups cost jobs.

482
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:00,489
I want Chase scared.

483
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:03,159
I want him doing everything he can
to protect his job.

484
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:07,102
Dr. House, if you were in his position,
wouldn't you be more likely
to perform well if you were reassured--

485
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:11,540
Oh, will you stop it
with the book?
Why are you doing this?

486
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:15,612
I'm not doing anything.
You're manipulating everyone.

487
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:22,383
People... dismiss me.

488
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:26,948
Because I'm a woman.
Because I'm pretty.

489
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:30,482
Because... I'm not aggressive.

490
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:35,731
My opinions shouldn't be rejected
just because people don't like me.

491
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,495
They like you.

492
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,703
Everyone likes you.

493
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:44,470
Do you?

494
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:05,762
I have to know.

495
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:08,361
No.

496
00:36:16,774 --> 00:36:18,708
Okay.

497
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:40,492
Five hours, 23 minutes.
That's fast.

498
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:43,090
Is that good or bad?
It depends.

499
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:46,466
Either surgery went really well,
or it ended really abruptly.

500
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:52,374
Textbook.
She'll outlive us all.

501
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,478
Thank you.

502
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:03,780
Triage nurse, pick up line 2741.

503
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:09,952
So, sing for me.

504
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:15,564
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Come on, look.

505
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:19,501
When you had your surgery,
you were intubated. The surgeon
stuck a tube down your throat.

506
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,733
Now, it never happens
and it's never caught,
but it happened.

507
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:27,335
Your vocal cords were paralyzed.
I treated the spastic dysphonia
with Botox.

508
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:30,676
Ironically, a substance
that tightens every other
corner of your face.

509
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:34,775
It actually loosens the tongue.
I have healed you.
You can talk.

510
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:42,625
Oh, well.

511
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:44,661
Boo!

512
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,831
Okay.

513
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:51,993
You don't have to say anything.
It can be our little secret.

514
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:55,527
If you can talk, blink twice.

515
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:00,808
But you're not going to,

516
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:05,440
because you think
you won't be entitled to the money
you won in the settlement with Simpson.

517
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:10,551
Yesterday, I would have said
you had to give the money back.

518
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:15,718
Today, hospital's
come into a lot of money.

519
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,727
Mum's the word.

520
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,326
Hey.

521
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,334
Hey.

522
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:04,103
I know the cardiologist
has given you some guidelines,

523
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:07,338
a schedule of medication
and a strict diet.

524
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:11,939
Just what somebody
with an eating disorder needs.

525
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:14,746
So I thought I'd get you started.

526
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:17,287
Fried chicken
from the Carnegie Deli.

527
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,090
- You're kidding.
- Yeah.

528
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:24,093
Actually, I got it downstairs.

529
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,701
Why did you fight for me?

530
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:36,467
You risked so much,
and you hardly know me.

531
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:44,247
You're my patient.

532
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:51,751
Don't screw it up.

533
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:39,495
Love this part!

534
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:49,144
Okay. He ruined it.

535
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:53,513
Just wanted to stop by
and introduce myself. I'm Edward Vogler,
new chairman of the board.

536
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:55,518
In a way, I guess
that makes me your boss.

537
00:40:57,421 --> 00:41:01,721
I am sorry
about the lab coat thing.
My dry cleaners just destroyed it.

538
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:07,122
That was my very first
heart transplant committee meeting.
Very exciting.

539
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:10,497
Trust me,
Six Flags-- way more exciting.

540
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:14,698
Your patient's very lucky
to have such a passionate doctor.
Stands up for what he believes in.

541
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:16,740
Sweet of you to say.

542
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:19,139
Yeah. Afraid
you've been duped though.

543
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:23,510
The nurse found this
in the patient's purse.

544
00:41:28,285 --> 00:41:31,152
Oh, my.
If only I'd known.

545
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:34,658
Tough being a doctor,
having all that power.

546
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:36,659
The power to play God.

547
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:40,754
Yes. I don't envy
the transplant committee
their responsibility.

548
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:44,597
They basically
would have been forced
to kill that poor girl.

549
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:46,761
I'm not sure
I could have done that.

550
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,864
This is not a game to me,
Dr. House.

551
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:55,901
No. It's actually
more like we're dancing
right now.

552
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,005
So let's get to the point.
You don't like me.

553
00:41:58,082 --> 00:42:01,711
I'm pretty sure
I'm not gonna like you.
It's nothing personal.

554
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:04,447
I don't like anybody.

555
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,456
But none of that
really matters, does it?

556
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:09,254
Because you've got money,
and I've got tenure.

557
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:13,558
You need full board approval
to get rid of me.
I've got Cuddy.

558
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:16,099
Right.
And Wilson.

559
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:19,761
So, as long as
we're stuck with each other,

560
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:22,032
we might as well
ignore each other.

561
00:42:28,445 --> 00:42:30,470
That wasn't nearly as dramatic
as I was hoping.

562
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:37,354
I looked into that tenure thing,
and you're right.

563
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:41,084
It's actually easier for me
to get rid of a board member
like Cuddy or Wilson...

564
00:42:41,158 --> 00:42:43,592
than to get rid of a doctor.

565
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:46,789
That's interesting, isn't it?
