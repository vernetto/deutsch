1
00:00:00,834 --> 00:00:03,735
And the only thing wrong--

2
00:00:03,803 --> 00:00:06,101
The only thing wrong
with the American dream...

3
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:08,766
is people--
too many people--

4
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:13,040
too many of us telling young people
that the dream is dead.

5
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:15,946
They told me that
when I was growing up
in the slums of Trenton.

6
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,246
And they were wrong.

7
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:23,312
They told me that
when I decided to run for senator,
with only $58 in my savings account.

8
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,950
And they were wrong.

9
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:29,860
And they are still telling me that now--
that I don't have a chance because I'm black,

10
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:35,390
because I don't have the right nose,
because I still only have $58
in my savings account.

11
00:00:44,844 --> 00:00:49,611
With your help,
we can keep that dream alive.

12
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:54,879
And in closing,

13
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,595
just...

14
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,002
let me say--

15
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,733
Let me say that you should all
donate the legal maximum...

16
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:17,743
to the next president
of the United States.

17
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,676
Are you okay? Do you need
some water or something?
No. I'm fine. I'm fine, really.

18
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,788
Handsome guy like you,
I bet you get 70% of the women.

19
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:32,654
Well, here's hoping.

20
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:35,523
Ofcourse, it helps
your wife died of cancer.

21
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:38,462
I mean, I'm sorry,
but the sympathy vote's
in your pocket.

22
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:40,362
Yeah, I appreciate your support.

23
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:44,802
Listen, Senator, my union
has a hell of a war chest.

24
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,738
Um, I've always been strong
on the union.

25
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:53,210
The thing is, you always go on
in your speeches about the workers...

26
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,873
in Indonesia, Cambodia, Timbuktu.

27
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,975
Because I think we have a--
a moral--

28
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:00,815
My union members are hurting.

29
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:05,119
They don't care about
moral this and moral that.
Are you all right?

30
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:06,852
- Senator?
- Ugh. Hey!

31
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:08,655
The guys are gonna love that.

32
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:15,290
Everyone, give him some room.
Give him room to breathe!

33
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:19,270
Back off, please!
Senator, are you all right?

34
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:56,166
The senator's suffering from nausea,
headache and mental confusion.

35
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:59,234
Ah, bad sushi
is so hard to diagnose.

36
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,838
You're being childish.

37
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:07,546
Look, if his case is as trivial
as you think, it'll take you
three minutes to diagnose.

38
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,556
Uh-huh. Three minutes that I
could spend sitting on the toilet
with the funny pages.

39
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:15,287
- You're mad at me.
- Nope.

40
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:18,091
I never liked Cameron or Foreman.

41
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:22,498
You know why I'm forcing you
to fire one of them? Because you need
to prove to me that you're a team player.

42
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:25,561
Now, if you did that,
you wouldn't need to go
through this exercise.

43
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:30,075
Fine. I'll hold the senator's hair
while he upchucks.

44
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:32,407
Oh, and, uh, by the way,

45
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:36,005
I need you to give a speech
at the National Cardiology Conference,
um, next week.

46
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:38,107
I don't do speeches. I'm shy.

47
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:42,484
Eastbrook Pharmaceuticals
has developed a new ACE inhibitor.

48
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:46,548
I would like you to extol the virtues
of this breakthrough medication.

49
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,787
Eastbrook Pharmaceuticals?

50
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:51,159
Wait a second?
Don't I own that company?

51
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,222
Oh, no, that's right. You do.

52
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:57,463
Viopril is a significant improvement
over the old version.

53
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:59,562
It's all there in the study.

54
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,766
I know its price tag
is significantly improved.

55
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:06,369
You can either give one 10-minute talk
and one three-minute diagnosis,

56
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:09,381
or you can fire one of your pets.

57
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:15,784
My understanding was that you believed
in rationality above all else.

58
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:25,256
Viopril.

59
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:28,960
I appreciate your keeping
the media away.

60
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:32,630
We're keeping
your staff away as well.
Take it easy now.

61
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:36,106
- I'm in the middle of a campaign.
- The faster we can get you better,
the faster you can get out of here.

62
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:39,508
Anyone else
at the fund-raiser get sick?

63
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:43,037
I don't think so, and I don't think that's it.
I've been under the weather for weeks.

64
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:46,574
Lots of traveling. I'm supposed
to be in the Sudan next week.

65
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:49,247
Oh!

66
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:52,317
Helps me concentrate.

67
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:55,088
Even better than drugs.

68
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:58,223
Open your mouth, please.

69
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:02,527
Ahh.

70
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:04,536
That's quite a scar.

71
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:07,334
When I was six, I fell off the swing
and bit my tongue.

72
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:10,308
Couldn't talk right
for the longest time.

73
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:15,177
Lots of teasing.
It just made me fight harder,
speak up for those who can't.

74
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,443
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

75
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:22,545
Tongues heal too fast.
Your political consultants
have written you a nice story.

76
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:26,820
In a tight race, the lispers alone
could put you over the top.

77
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:29,487
You a Republican,
or you just hate all politicians?

78
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:33,658
I just find being forced
to sit through drivel annoying.

79
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,462
You find sincerity annoying?

80
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:37,628
You're a black kid from the ghetto...

81
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:41,037
who made it to Yale Law
and the United States Senate.

82
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:44,406
That's a sufficiently mythical story.
You don't need to lie about your tongue.

83
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,678
Must've missed it.

84
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,413
What's wrong?

85
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:05,821
What is it?
It's not the food.
It's your brain.

86
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:08,731
Get an M.R.I.
and a lumbar puncture.

87
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:10,792
Cancel your travel plans.

88
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:22,911
The senator's L.P.
showed no sign of infection,
and the M.R.I. looks fairly clean.

89
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:26,941
I guess we can tell him
he's fairly healthy and can go home.

90
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:29,078
Well, there is something
in Broca's area,

91
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:31,623
but it's small,
low intensity.

92
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:35,627
Most likely
just background noise.
Care to bet your job on that?

93
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:38,289
What was that?
What was what?

94
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:41,458
You got annoyed.
That was clearly
an annoyed face.

95
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,695
I get annoyed by glib remarks
about our futures.

96
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:48,605
Last week you didn't get annoyed.
You made poopie in your pants.
It's weird.

97
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:52,110
It's almost like now you know
you have nothing to worry about.

98
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:54,169
Chase has nothing
to worry about?

99
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,738
None of you has anything
to worry about.

100
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:58,750
What happened?

101
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:02,720
Vogler saw the error of his ways
and repented.

102
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:06,486
The lesion could be nothing.
Also could be a brain tumor
or an infection.

103
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:08,584
There's only one way
to find out which.

104
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:11,255
You want to cut into his brain?

105
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:15,061
Dangerous, I know.
Especially since he's a politician,
his brain's all twisted.

106
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:19,935
But I weighed that against the risk
of him stroking out before lunch.
Call Surgery. Get it scheduled.

107
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:33,781
- You're not pregnant.
- Well, I told you that.

108
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:36,913
There's got to be some other reason
I'm still spotting.

109
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:39,423
Sure. You were pregnant.

110
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:42,689
Based on your hormone levels,
you've had a miscarriage.

111
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:44,662
I haven't even been on a date.

112
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:48,928
Right. And since
it's physically impossible to have sex
without someone buying you dinner--

113
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:52,801
I haven't had sex
since I split up with my husband.

114
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:56,501
- That was almost a year ago.
- Fine. Have it your way.

115
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:58,510
Immaculate conception.

116
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:02,776
- Um, what do I do?
- Well, it's obvious.

117
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,817
Start a religion.

118
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:10,779
In my office.

119
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:17,527
Afternoon delight.
She just loves the hard wood.

120
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:23,625
You're not doing a brain biopsy
based on a spot on an M.R.I.

121
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:25,637
Where'd you get that?

122
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:27,798
Not on a United States senator.

123
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:32,038
Oh, just so I'm clear--
If he was a janitor, that would be okay?
Do you have a list?

124
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:35,376
A brain biopsy can cause
permanent neurological damage.

125
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:39,043
Uh-huh. Whereas tumors
are really good for brains.
Make 'em grow big and strong.

126
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:42,315
- It's my call.
- No, it's not.

127
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:46,017
- You're pulling rank on patient care?
- It's not my call either.

128
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:51,029
- It's up to you.
- Either it's a tumor or it's an infection
that the lumbar puncture didn't pick up.

129
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:53,588
Either way,
unless we treat it immediately,
it could kill you.

130
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,226
Or it could be nothing.
Reading brain M.R.I.'s
is not an exact science.

131
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,327
Well, what caused my s-symptoms?

132
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:01,271
Wow! Excellent question.
Many doctors wouldn't
have gone there.

133
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,399
It could be
a transient ischemic attack.

134
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:08,072
You could make the argument
for watching carefully
for the time being.

135
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:11,674
Hmm, but you'd only make that argument
if you were an administrator
covering your ass.

136
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:14,276
That's absurd and insulting.
Insulting, yes.

137
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:16,412
What would the voters think?

138
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:20,687
If they find out
I've had a b-brain biopsy?

139
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,554
This could leave you
b-b-b-brain damaged,

140
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:27,929
and you're worried
about NASCAR dads?

141
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:48,217
It's not a brain tumor.

142
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,482
It's not a bacterial infection either.

143
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:53,753
So you biopsied his brain
for nothing?

144
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:58,559
If that were true,
would Dr. Wilson's mouth
be contorted into that ugly shape?

145
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:02,999
It's toxoplasmosis.

146
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:05,060
You sure?

147
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:08,573
Which means the Great Black Hope
has full-blown AIDS.

148
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:15,007
They're gonna love that
in Dubuque.

149
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:21,351
Toxoplasmosis
is a fairly common fungus
you can get...

150
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,548
from eating under-cooked meat
or touching cat feces.

151
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,889
In rare cases,
the fungi travel up the bloodstream
and latch onto the brain,

152
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,861
causing a lesion
or inflammation.

153
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,421
So, what's the prognosis?

154
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,998
Toxo usually responds
to treatment,

155
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:43,440
but it only causes a lesion in your brain
if your immune system is extremely weak
to begin with.

156
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:48,707
Senator, I'm afraid you have AIDS.

157
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:54,543
As I'm sure--

158
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:58,522
No!
As I'm sure you know,
people with H.I.V. can live a long time.

159
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:02,288
- What else could do this to me?
- Theoretically, certain cancers.

160
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:05,296
If you have toxo in your brain,
you have AIDS.

161
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:10,465
I do not have AIDS.

162
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:14,199
I don't sh-- sh-- shoot up drugs.

163
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:18,004
I don't s-sleep with--

164
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:21,069
This is very bad news.
I get that, and I sympathize.

165
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:25,413
But we gotta speed through
the denial phase because you need
antiretrovirals and you need them fast.

166
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:32,951
But-- You haven't even
tested me for H.I.V.!

167
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:36,961
- We will.
- But the toxo drugs
are gonna piss off your fungi.

168
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,088
And when fungi get pissed--

169
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:42,760
I am not going to take the pills.

170
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:45,463
You're afraid word will leak out.

171
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,707
Trust me. You're not gonna
be president either way.

172
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:52,676
They don't call it the White House
because of the paint job.

173
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:55,111
Here's what you're gonna do.

174
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:59,277
You're gonna give me the drugs
for the toxo only.

175
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,852
You're going to test me for H.I.V.,
under a false name.

176
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:06,585
You are going to test me for cancer...

177
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:09,651
and anything else
that could have done this to me.

178
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:13,256
If I have cancer,
I will deal with it.

179
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:18,526
But I do not...

180
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:21,164
have AIDS.

181
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:26,033
"Eastbrook Pharmaceuticals
are pleased to announce...

182
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:30,742
that Dr. Gregory House
will present the latest research
on our exciting new ACE inhibitor".

183
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,811
You're making that up.
That's Vogler's company.

184
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:39,449
Press release.
"During an address at the North
American Cardiology Conference".

185
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:46,328
- House never gives speeches.
- But when I really believe in something--

186
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:49,231
Gosh dang it, I got a chance
to make a difference here.

187
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,235
You made a deal with Vogler?

188
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:54,962
It's all the rage.
Everybody's doing it.

189
00:12:56,075 --> 00:13:00,842
So, what's the deal?
You get to keep all of us
if you flog his products?

190
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:02,710
One speech. No biggie.

191
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:07,242
Foreman's doing a bone marrow biopsy
to check for cancer.

192
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:09,048
Cancer?
The senator's got AIDS.

193
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,555
Cancer sounds better
in a press release.

194
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,422
I need you guys to rush
the ELISA test for H.I.V.

195
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:16,654
Thank you.

196
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:18,492
For the speech.

197
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:21,055
When I said rush,
I meant, you know, fast.

198
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:24,102
- "Stat's" the word you doctors use, right?
- I know it's hard for you.

199
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,104
Double stat?

200
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:32,400
This may sting a little.

201
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:36,970
Sorry.
It wasn't the shot.

202
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:40,678
It's, um-- My head's killing me.

203
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:43,415
Senator, we don't have
to do this now.

204
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,822
We can hold off
till your H.I.V. test comes back.

205
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:49,588
Because you figure
it's gonna come back positive.

206
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,755
In my experience--
Patients lie.

207
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:55,767
Politicians lie more.
Black politicians--

208
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,770
Oh. I don't think black politicians lie
more than white politicians.

209
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:02,638
- We lie less.
- You figure we're morally superior?

210
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,734
I've got my theories.

211
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:09,975
No, we--
we just can't get away with it.

212
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:16,488
No one's gonna g-give us
the benefit of the doubt.

213
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:19,251
No one's gonna cut us
a second chance.

214
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:23,728
And when it happens,
it's not just a-- a bad politician.

215
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:26,094
It's-- It's a bad role model.

216
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:29,623
It's a-- a dis--

217
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:33,433
discredit to the race.

218
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,950
You ready?
Yeah.

219
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,987
Yeah.

220
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:55,159
Take a deep breath.

221
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,696
Dr. House, I just wanted--

222
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:08,103
You're welcome again.
I want you to know how much--

223
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:10,698
Got it. You're grateful.

224
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:13,609
Apparently you seem to think
it will mean a lot to me to know that.

225
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,170
Do you know why people
pray to God?

226
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,716
I thought
you didn't believe in God.
I don't.

227
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:21,184
Well, then you better be making
a very good point.

228
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:24,711
Do you think they pray to him
and praise him because they want him
to know how great he is?

229
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,348
God already knows that.

230
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:30,689
Are you comparing me to God?

231
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,357
I mean, that's great,
but just so you know,
I've never made a tree.

232
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:38,660
I thank you because
it means something to me...

233
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,230
to be grateful
for what I receive.

234
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:51,241
You are the most naive atheist
I've ever met.

235
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:54,218
Dr. House, you have
a patient in room one.

236
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:57,585
Thank God.

237
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:02,184
People pray so that God
won't crush them like bugs.

238
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:08,499
I'm not gonna crush you.

239
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:15,096
"Petechial" bruising?
I don't know if I pronounced that right.

240
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,836
Gosh, the Internet
is such a wonderful tool.

241
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:21,505
It could be leukemia.
Definitely possible.

242
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,912
The more likely diagnosis
is hickey.

243
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,713
Well, it can't be a hickey.

244
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:29,276
Why is everybody so ashamed of sex
all of a sudden?

245
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:31,255
I'm not having sex.

246
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,622
I've barely even thought about sex
since my marriage. Ow!

247
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:37,355
I say you're having sex,
you say you're not.

248
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:40,364
Either you're lying
or I'm wrong.

249
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:43,560
- Or there's some middle ground.
- You mean, like, oral?

250
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:46,103
I mean, you're having sex
without knowing it.

251
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,231
I'm testing you for booze,
drugs and G.H.B.

252
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:52,709
I don't drink or-- What's G.H.B.?

253
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,939
The date-rape drug.

254
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:14,231
It's positive.

255
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:30,513
Your "T" cell count is eight,

256
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:33,073
which means
there's a good chance you'll die.

257
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:38,780
I'm telling you this because we need
to contact your sexual partners.

258
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:41,621
I've only had two girlfriends.

259
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:44,821
Two. After my wife died.

260
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:48,355
I used c-condoms.

261
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:52,837
You know the chances of you getting H.I. V.
from heterosexual sex with a condom?

262
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,032
Yes.

263
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:57,041
Someday there will be
a black president.

264
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,270
Someday there will be
a gay president.

265
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:02,370
Maybe there'll even be
a gay, black president.

266
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:06,145
But one combination
I do not see happening
is gay, black and dead.

267
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:09,945
You need to stop lying to me.

268
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:13,185
It must be miserable,
always assuming the worst in people.

269
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,317
Cut the crap. You're dying.

270
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:18,557
And you're clever, you're witty
and you are a coward.

271
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,996
You're scared of taking chances.

272
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:24,502
- I take chances all the time.
It's one of my worst qualities.
- On people?

273
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:31,839
Wanting to believe
the best about people
doesn't make it true.

274
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,741
Being afraid to believe it
doesn't make it false.

275
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:36,713
Well, that's very moving.
It's a shame I don't vote.
Hmm.

276
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:40,047
This is who I am.
I believe in people.

277
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,350
I'm not hiply cynical,
and I don't make easy, snide remarks.

278
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:48,155
I would rather think that people are good
and be disappointed once and again.

279
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:07,405
I need to draw some more blood.

280
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:43,706
Nurse!

281
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:45,773
The antiretrovirals aren't working.

282
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,842
That's not surprising.

283
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:51,645
He's just gonna keep getting worse.
You realize that, right?

284
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:53,782
Why are you spying on my case?

285
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,054
Why are you giving
that speech next week?

286
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:58,892
We're both just doing
what we have to do.
You don't see a problem with that?

287
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:01,296
Checking in on a patient?

288
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,994
Yeah, wow. How do I look
myself in the mirror?

289
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:06,663
You're not the one being asked
to perpetrate a fraud
on the American people.

290
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:09,730
It's a 10-minute speech.
That I've been ordered to give.

291
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:12,402
Vogler's drug works.
Don't care.

292
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:16,470
Why do you have to make
everything so dramatic?
I'm a very high-strung little lap dog.

293
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,592
Uh-uh. No pills.

294
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:32,323
What's going on?

295
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:35,628
The antiretrovirals
aren't working.

296
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:38,602
Why not?

297
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,104
Because you don't have AIDS.

298
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,168
The first test was a false positive.

299
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,678
Happens one time in every 5,000.

300
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,306
You r-ran a second test?

301
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:53,351
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

302
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:56,387
You're still dying.

303
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:02,557
The only difference is,
now we don't know why.

304
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,801
He's continuing to lose control
of the muscles on his right side.

305
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:20,106
- His brain is getting foggier,
and his "T" cells are still in single digits.
- Why are we doing this here?

306
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:22,203
So Cuddy can't find us.

307
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:26,081
Unless we figure out
the underlying disease,
this guy's lied to his last constituent.

308
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:29,211
- False negative
on the P.C.R. AIDS test?
- Ran it twice.

309
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:33,218
- Immunoglobulin deficiency?
- No history of respiratory problems.

310
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,226
Idiopathic "T" cell deficiency.

311
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:39,958
Idiopathic-- from the Latin
meaning "we're idiots" 'cause we
can't figure out what's causing it.

312
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:43,094
Give him a whole body scan.

313
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:46,160
- You hate whole body scans.
- 'Cause they're useless.

314
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:50,174
Could probably scan any one of us
and find five different doodads
that look like cancer.

315
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:53,734
But when you're fourth down
and a hundred to go, in the snow,

316
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,747
you don't call
a running play up the middle,
unless you're the Jets.

317
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:01,410
I hate sports metaphors.

318
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,750
Why did you order
the second AIDS test?

319
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,950
Standard procedure.
Oh, well, that's you--
Mr. Standard Procedure.

320
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:09,516
You suspected the first test
was a false positive?

321
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:13,394
I knew he was going to Africa,
and I figured he was vaccinated
for Hep "A" and "B".

322
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:15,456
That could cause a false positive.

323
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:20,528
- You knew that before you ordered
the first test. What changed?
- I should have ordered both.

324
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:22,596
You were sure he had AIDS.

325
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:26,269
Then you talked to him,
then you had doubts.
What did he say?

326
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:30,941
He said he had not engaged
in any risky behavior.

327
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,007
Huh. And you believed him.

328
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:35,349
He didn't have any reason to lie.

329
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,980
Everybody lies, except politicians?

330
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:41,719
House,
I believe you're a romantic.

331
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:44,227
You didn't just believe him,
you believed in him!

332
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:47,026
Do you want to come over tonight
and watch old movies and cry?

333
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:49,829
Dr. Cameron's getting to you.

334
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:52,665
Well, I guess you can't
be around that much niceness
and not get any on you.

335
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:55,070
Is that why you haven't put
the moves on her?

336
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,735
What makes you think
I haven't put the moves on her?

337
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:04,011
Oh! Oh, boy! You're in trouble.

338
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:17,257
You have restored my faith
in the human race.

339
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:21,663
- You're lying.
- No. I'm not lying.

340
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:25,169
Just got your results back.
No G.H.B., no nothing.

341
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:28,695
It means you're having sex
and you're lying about it.

342
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:31,572
No. And I have a new symptom.

343
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:35,841
I have a rash on my butt.

344
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:40,744
Do you wanna? Yeah.

345
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:50,024
- What is it?
- It's a carpet burn.

346
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,188
No. It can't be.

347
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,732
Doctor, I love sex.

348
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,792
I miss it.
I haven't had any in over a year.

349
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:03,364
Well, you managed to keep
this appointment, so you have
no short-term memory problem.

350
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:07,037
Multiple personalities?
Do you find yourself
losing chunks of time?

351
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:12,573
Do you wake up, and you don't
remember falling asleep?
No. I just wake up really exhausted.

352
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:16,212
- Something upsetting you?
- No.

353
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:21,391
My ex lives
in the apartment downstairs.

354
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:25,294
He's always calling me,
always wanting to get back together,
complaining about mixed signals.

355
00:24:25,363 --> 00:24:29,129
"Get out of my life."
How much clearer can you get?

356
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:33,337
We have a sleep lab
in the basement.

357
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:37,671
If nothing else, it will get you away
from your ex for a night.

358
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:54,019
Slightly enlarged lymph node
in his left armpit.

359
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:56,117
How slightly?
Quarter mil.

360
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:58,128
- Lymphoma?
- Sure.

361
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:00,756
Or he's had a cold
in the last six months.

362
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:05,462
- What, you got her on speed dial?
- I just follow the scent of arrogance.

363
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:10,372
Another slightly enlarged node over here.
Two more in his neck and one in his groin.

364
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:14,674
- And there's a cyst in his liver.
- It looks complex.
Central necrosis?

365
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:16,771
Spontaneous bleeding.
It's benign.

366
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:20,375
I was rooting for a really cool tumor.
Instead we're stuck with this crap.

367
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:23,046
Doesn't matter. Once you find 'em,
you gotta check 'em.

368
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:26,887
Knock yourselves out.

369
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:28,949
I just saw Senator Wright.
He looks like hell.

370
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,860
That sushi must've been
a lot worse than you thought.

371
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:35,889
Mr. Vogler, would you like
a free whole body scan?

372
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:39,198
A man of your stature
should get himself checked
at least three times a year.

373
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:43,401
Here's a few key points
I want you to cover
during your speech.

374
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:47,244
Fourteen pages.

375
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:50,076
The audience will be comatose
by paragraph two.

376
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:52,548
Throw in a joke.

377
00:25:56,454 --> 00:25:59,150
Dr. Chase, we need to talk.

378
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:05,661
- How do you see this ending?
- What ending?

379
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:10,724
I can't fire you,
so you have no reason to fear me
and, therefore, no reason to lie to me.

380
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:15,739
You told Cuddy where I was.
You told Vogler what I was doing.

381
00:26:20,178 --> 00:26:24,410
Yeah.
So how can I work with you?

382
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:28,711
Well, you don't have a choice.

383
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:34,453
This might hurt a little.

384
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:37,256
Lie to me.

385
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:40,230
Okay.
It'll feel like a gentle massage.

386
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:43,233
House...

387
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:46,464
is a lousy teacher.

388
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:49,735
You can't lie for beans.

389
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:51,969
Have you ever told
any really big ones?

390
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:53,977
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

391
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:58,607
I might be messed up,
but I'm not that out of it.

392
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:02,119
Strap his arm down.

393
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,430
Am I going to be okay?

394
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:16,399
I hope so.

395
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:25,002
I am selling my soul.

396
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:28,739
Just a little piece.
And you are getting
something in return.

397
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,748
I said I was selling it.
Didn't say I was giving it away.

398
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:35,308
That would be immoral
and stupid.

399
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:37,446
All they've done
is add an antacid.

400
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:39,422
Does it work?
That's not the point.

401
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:42,324
Ofcourse it's the point.
He's not asking you to lie.

402
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:45,921
He's not asking you
to do something illegal.
He's not asking me to do anything.

403
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,966
He's not ordering you.
He gave you a choice.
You chose your staff.

404
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:53,267
I know this isn't easy for you.
You'll suffer.

405
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,602
Vicodin sales in Jersey will triple.

406
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,699
But you are doing a good thing.

407
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:08,177
Only you could feel like crap
about doing something good.

408
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:13,179
Kidney and liver cysts are both benign,
and the lymph nodes all came back clean.

409
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:18,059
- His left armpit node has antibodies for C.D. 11.
- Not enough to indicate lymphoma.

410
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:20,222
We never tested
for hairy cell leukemia.

411
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:23,961
No, but we would have
picked it up somewhere else
besides one lymph node.

412
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:28,028
- And his spleen isn't enlarged.
- Size isn't everything.

413
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:30,540
The spleen is the mother lode
for hairy cells.

414
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,409
Let's cut it open.

415
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:36,879
You can't biopsy his spleen.
It'll bleed like stink.

416
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:40,816
In the senator's condition,
a spleen biopsy could easily
cause sepsis and kill him.

417
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,910
Why do you do this to me?

418
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:46,354
Now if I kill him,
I can't tell the judge I had no idea
of the risks involved.

419
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:49,825
His brain is turning into mush,
and he's at risk for more infections.
We have to do it.

420
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:52,692
See? That'll sound
much better in court.

421
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:56,700
Okay. Go tell our human pincushion
we'll be sticking him one more time.

422
00:28:58,536 --> 00:29:01,232
Cuddy.

423
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:03,240
Don't you hate doing this?

424
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:06,934
Yeah.

425
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:23,684
What's up?

426
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:28,522
You like me.

427
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:32,803
Why?

428
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:37,805
That's kind of a sad question.

429
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:42,869
I'm just trying to figure out
what makes you tick.

430
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:47,247
I am not warm and fuzzy,
and you are basically a stuffed animal
made by Grandma.

431
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:49,309
I don't think
that's why you're asking.

432
00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:53,949
- I think this is because of the speech.
- God, don't try and pick me apart.

433
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:56,084
Then why are you asking?

434
00:29:57,162 --> 00:29:59,096
What do you want to hear?

435
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:23,781
Hey, Senator. We need to do
one more biopsy-- on your spleen.

436
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:27,689
I'll have to sign lefty.

437
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:30,250
My fingers aren't working.

438
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:38,125
Have you been coughing a lot?

439
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:40,262
Does it hurt?

440
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:43,273
It's like I can't get air.

441
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:46,976
Is that from the toxo?

442
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:51,641
No. This is-- This is new.

443
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:56,545
You don't need to sign.
We can't do the biopsy.

444
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:07,426
The senator's breathing
is severely impaired.

445
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:09,796
His O2 sat levels are at 89.

446
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,336
His silver stain indicates
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.

447
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:15,270
Another killer fungus.
It's consistent
with hairy cell leukemia.

448
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:18,332
But we can't biopsy his spleen.
Respiratory distress.

449
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:21,173
His platelets are 20 and dropping.
His blood won't clot worth a damn.

450
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:23,942
There's gotta be another way
to diagnose hairy cell.

451
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:27,178
No. His bone marrow's indeterminate.
Spleen biopsy's the only way to go.

452
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:30,221
You know, when the Inuit go fishing,
they don't look for fish.

453
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:39,026
Why, Dr. House?

454
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:43,431
They look for the blue heron
because there's no way to see the fish.

455
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:46,197
But if there's fish,
there's gonna be birds fishing.

456
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:49,502
Now, if he's got hairy cell,
what else should we see circling overhead?

457
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:53,704
- He should have all sorts of weird viruses.
- H.T.L.V. and A.T.L.V.

458
00:31:53,778 --> 00:31:57,475
We can test for them.
Run the titers.

459
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,919
These were your brain waves
at 2:45 a.m.

460
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:05,547
Now, here it comes.
There's an abrupt jump
from slow-wave sleep.

461
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,519
This indicates
partial sleep arousal.

462
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:12,825
Most common type is somnambulism.
Sleepwalking.

463
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:15,491
That would explain why
I'm so tired when I wake up.

464
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:17,864
Yes. And also why
you were pregnant.

465
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:21,862
And the hickeys.
And the carpet burn.

466
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,704
I had sex in my sleep?

467
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,438
Sexsomnia
is a documented disorder.

468
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:31,208
You said your ex lives downstairs.
I'll kill him.

469
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:35,082
Okay. But he probably didn't know
that you were asleep.

470
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:37,519
Sexsomniacs
can act pretty normal.

471
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:40,955
I'm gonna write you a prescription
for a low-dose antidepressant.

472
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:43,016
It'll let you sleep better.

473
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:47,087
If you wanna save yourself the $15 co-pay,
you could have sex while you're awake.

474
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,957
- He's my ex. I don't--
- You live in the same building.

475
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:55,062
You haven't had sex
with anyone else for a year.
You sleepwalk right into his arms.

476
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:58,233
Call me crazy,
but I'm sensing unresolved issues.

477
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,841
Negative
for H.T.L.V. 1 and 2.

478
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:07,578
And negative for A.T.L.V.
and everything else.

479
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:10,382
It's not hairy cell.

480
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:13,288
Hey. You really
gonna give that speech?

481
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:17,758
You got an opinion too?
I'm a little surprised.

482
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:21,925
Frankly, I thought you were too much
of a self-absorbed ass to do this for us.

483
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,333
You're welcome.
He's positive for Epstein-Barr.

484
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:27,394
So what?

485
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:30,236
It doesn't point to hairy cell.
It's irrelevant.

486
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:44,288
Hey.

487
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,823
You didn't fall off the swings
when you were eight.

488
00:33:46,891 --> 00:33:49,951
S-S-Six.

489
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,428
Ever.

490
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:55,762
Give that back.
Uh-uh. We have to talk.

491
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:57,824
You had an epileptic seizure.

492
00:33:57,902 --> 00:34:00,063
That's how you bit your tongue.

493
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:03,369
I-I haven't had a seizure since--

494
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:06,808
What medication did you take?

495
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,972
No s-s-seizure since I was six.

496
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:14,644
No dr-dr-drugs s-since I was 10.

497
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,813
Yeah, that's it. Don't worry about
what the question is.

498
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:22,121
Don't worry that you're
starting to feel dizzy.
Just stay on message.

499
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,123
My--

500
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:32,499
My mother used to call it--

501
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,504
"funny-something".

502
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:37,063
- Phenytoin?
- Yes!

503
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:42,202
Okay, okay. You're okay.

504
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:46,940
It's okay.

505
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,244
Everybody lies.

506
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:57,924
Senator Gary H. Wright of New Jersey
had childhood epilepsy.

507
00:34:57,995 --> 00:34:59,929
He took phenytoin.

508
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:01,988
That drug,
with the Epstein-Barr virus,

509
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:05,092
is associated with common variable
immunodeficiency disease.

510
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:09,367
"T" cells down, "B" cells down.
Keeps you from forming
enough antibodies.

511
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,204
See, the antibodies are basically
your defensive line.

512
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:16,076
And your brain
is like the quarterback.

513
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:20,516
And then the fungi
are like blitzing linebackers
plunging up the middle.

514
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:22,519
Your lungs are like--

515
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:26,214
Okay, you got two quarterbacks.
C. V.I.D.?

516
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:29,259
That's a type
of immunoglobulin deficiency.
I said that.

517
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:33,229
Yeah. Well, it was a stupid idea
when you said it.

518
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:36,198
Then he got the respiratory problem,
and he tested positive for Epstein-Barr.

519
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:38,098
That's pretty much
a childhood disease.

520
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:41,798
That's another reason why
Chase's suggestion was idiotic.
He got it when he was a kid.

521
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:44,364
He didn't get
any symptoms until now.
It happens.

522
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:48,310
It gets triggered by stress--
like public speaking.

523
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:53,476
So you're basing your diagnosis
on a virus that's relatively common
and a drug he took 30 years ago.

524
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:56,748
Start the senator
on I.V. immunoglobulin, stat.

525
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,551
If he gets better, I'm right.
If he dies, you're right.

526
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:40,263
Dr. House?

527
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:47,828
You faked that.
No.

528
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:51,168
Say "antiretroviral".
Antiretroviral.

529
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:54,143
Now, say it three times fast.

530
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,874
We just got your latest blood results.
Your white cells are up.

531
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:59,849
Your "T" cells
are back over a hundred.
That's-That's good, right?

532
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:01,714
In a week? That's terrific.

533
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:06,450
You'll need medication
for the rest of your life,
but other than that, you're fine.

534
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:08,492
Am I well enough
to run for president?

535
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,357
- Why not run for pope
while you're at it?
- Oh, come on.

536
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:15,490
Kennedy had Addison's. F.D.R. had polio.
Two of the best presidents
in the last hundred years.

537
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:18,364
If they were running today,
they wouldn't stand a chance.

538
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:21,530
You figure you'd be surgeon general
if you didn't have the limp?

539
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:24,866
No. There's things I can't do.

540
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:28,878
And like you said,
I... have to live with reality.

541
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:31,210
Well, then I'm running.

542
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:33,147
Good for you.

543
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:36,914
Now, don't get excited.
He's right. I, uh-- I won't win.

544
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:40,549
Then why run?

545
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:47,895
Oh, I see. Your point being,
the only way to make a difference
is to win every fight.

546
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,263
But, hey, why listen to me?

547
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,934
I own the company.
I'm certainly not to be trusted, right?

548
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:04,673
Dr. Greg House,
on the other hand,
has a reputation...

549
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:08,845
for integrity,
among other things.

550
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:13,120
Ladies and gentlemen,
Dr. Greg House.

551
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:34,608
Eastbrook Pharmaceuticals'
extraordinary commitment
to research excellence...

552
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:37,170
is exemplified
by their new ACE inhibitor,

553
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:41,241
a breakthrough medical approach
that will protect millions
from heart disease.

554
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,464
That's not a speech.

555
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:56,898
I thought it was pithy.

556
00:38:56,967 --> 00:39:01,461
You got enough
for a press release anyhow.
Foreman or Cameron.

557
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:15,446
A few things I forgot to mention.

558
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:18,750
Ed Vogler
is a brilliant businessman,

559
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:21,223
a brilliant judge of people...

560
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:25,194
and a man
who has never lost a fight.

561
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:30,790
You know how I know
that the new ACE inhibitor is good?

562
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:35,498
'Cause the old one was good.
The new one is really the same,
just more expensive.

563
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:38,303
A lot more expensive.

564
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,641
You see, that's another example
of Ed's brilliance.

565
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:44,374
Whenever one of his drugs
is about to lose its patent,

566
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:49,112
he has his boys and girls
alter it just a tiny bit,
patent it all over again,

567
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:52,178
making not just a pointless new pill,

568
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:54,622
but millions and millions of dollars.

569
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:57,286
Which is good for everybody, right?

570
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:59,795
Except the patients.
But-- who cares?

571
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:01,855
They're just so damn sick.

572
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:04,298
God obviously
never liked them anyway.

573
00:40:05,936 --> 00:40:10,134
All the healthy people in the room,
let's have a big round of applause
for Ed Vogler.

574
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:23,149
I threw in a joke.

575
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:19,442
I'm sorry.

576
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:24,711
I should've taken an extra couple
of Vicodin and just held my nose.

577
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:28,878
- I'm guessing you did take
a couple extra Vicodin.
- True.

578
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:36,788
You don't need to worry
about firing anyone.
I'm leaving.

579
00:41:38,462 --> 00:41:40,453
Why?

580
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:48,833
Is this another noble,
self-sacrificing gesture?

581
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:52,340
Are you trying
to protect Foreman?
No.

582
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:55,276
So this is just,
"Don't fire me. I quit"?

583
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,906
I'm protecting myself.

584
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:05,180
You asked me why I like you.

585
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:08,521
You're abrasive and rude.

586
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:14,096
But I figured, everything you do,
you do it to help people.

587
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:18,258
But I was wrong.

588
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:22,161
You do it because it's right.

589
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:47,359
There are only two ways
that I can deal with things.

590
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:50,697
One is in my control.

591
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:56,529
That's to leave.

592
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:05,343
Good-bye, House.
