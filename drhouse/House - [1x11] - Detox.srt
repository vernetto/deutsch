1
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:18,474
What do you say now?

2
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:20,746
I don't know.

3
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,584
You said your dad
wouldn't be home for an hour.

4
00:00:23,656 --> 00:00:26,557
I know, but it-- You don't know--
Don't you love me?

5
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:29,356
Ofcourse. You know I--
Then, come on.
Let's do it.

6
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,421
All right.

7
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:46,841
Where are they?
Nightstand.

8
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:55,819
Gentlemen, start your engines.

9
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:03,589
I so want this car!

10
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:05,722
Whoo-hoo!

11
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:08,199
Whoo-hoo!

12
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:10,793
Whoo-hoo!

13
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:30,289
Oh, my God!
You're bleeding.

14
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:32,654
Look out!

15
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:34,352
What lie are they telling you?

16
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:38,481
I'll check on it.
Okay. Yes--

17
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:41,994
Come on.

18
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:45,326
Okay, thank you.

19
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:47,696
Okay, pharmaceuticals
were delivered this morning.

20
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:50,702
But Shipping accidentally sent
the box with Vicodin to Research.

21
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,204
Hmm. That's a tough one.

22
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:57,334
If only we had some way
to communicate with
another part of the building.

23
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:00,679
Sixteen-year-old
M.V.A. victim.

24
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:04,046
He's been in and out of the hospital
for three weeks with internal bleeding.
No one can find the cause.

25
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:07,018
Internal bleeding after a car accident.
Wow, that's shocking.

26
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:09,418
Let me talk to Shipping.
I speak their language.

27
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:13,084
It's been three weeks--
Your hospital doesn't have
my pain medication.

28
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:15,650
Shipping says
it's going to be an hour.

29
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:17,662
This is Dr. Cuddy.
What's going on?

30
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,665
The crash didn't cause the bleed.
Right-- the bleed
caused the crash.

31
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:24,328
Blood got on the road, got all slippery--
Anyone here got drugs?

32
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:30,103
She saw his blood,
she got distracted,
and she crashed his dad's Porsche.

33
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,768
- Dad'll love that.
- He was--

34
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:33,402
- Don't talk.
- It's gonna be an hour.

35
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,606
Thank God you took control.

36
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:38,617
- If you can't wait one hour to get--
- Kid's got hemolytic anemia.

37
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,550
Kid? How old?

38
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,021
He must have inherited it.
He's gonna die. My condolences.

39
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,854
Wasn't inherited. The problem's
outside the red blood cells.

40
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:49,588
This is impossible.
A 16-year-old does not
get hemolytic anemia.

41
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:53,792
Give her back the file.
You have bigger problems
to tend to, like my meds.

42
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:57,165
Elevated indirect bilirubin,
low serum haptoglobin--

43
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,762
- He's got meningitis.
- Uh, no.

44
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:04,401
- Artificial heart valve.
- No.

45
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:12,474
Get everyone in my office.

46
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:16,046
Kid's gonna be dead
in a matter of days...

47
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:19,057
if we don't figure out why
his red blood cells are disintegrating.

48
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,593
So, differential diagnosis, people.
Well,
it's not environmental.

49
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:24,892
Dad hired a company to clean the house,
maid washed all the clothes...

50
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:26,898
and bought hypoallergenic
sheets and pillows.

51
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:28,900
- You want us to recheck?
- No.

52
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:30,936
If it's environmental,
he'll get better just from staying here.

53
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:33,438
- It could be an infection.
- No fever. No white count.

54
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:36,168
- Well, he's 99.2.
- Barely above normal.

55
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:39,234
But above.
His body's reacting to something.

56
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:42,247
We could account for the lack
of fever and white count if it's lupus.

57
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:45,944
Drugs will fit just as much as lupus.
Meth will cause hemolytic anemia.

58
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,953
A lot of meth.

59
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:50,080
Also doesn't exactly
seem like the type.

60
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:54,183
Because his dad drives a Porsche?
Rich kids do drugs just like poor kids.

61
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,194
Didn't mean to offend you.
Okay!

62
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:59,129
So it's infection, lupus,
drugs or cancer.

63
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:02,599
- Cancer?
- Why not? Great meeting.

64
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:05,866
Shouldn't we narrow it down
before we finish?

65
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:07,963
My leg gave us till 11:15.

66
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,373
I'll talk to Wilson about lymphoma,
A.N.A. for lupus,

67
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,775
radioimmunoassay for drugs,

68
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:15,780
and you test for
whatever you thought it was.

69
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:18,316
I've got a date
with the pharmacist.

70
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:20,716
That's already done, and--

71
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:24,154
Come on!
Come on, come on, come on.

72
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:26,214
Yeah.

73
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,825
Excuse me.

74
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:42,333
You know, there are other ways
to manage pain.

75
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,137
Like what? Laughter?

76
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,008
Meditation? Got a guy
that can fix my third chakra?

77
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,173
You're addicted.

78
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:53,685
If the pills ran my life, I'd agree with you,
but it's my leg that's busy
calendaring what I can't do.

79
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:55,687
You're in denial.

80
00:05:55,755 --> 00:06:00,089
Right. I never had an infarction in my leg.
No dead muscle, no nerve damage.

81
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:02,593
Doesn't even hurt.
Actually, it kinda tickles.

82
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:04,596
And chicks dig this...

83
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:06,598
better than a puppy.

84
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,601
It's not just your leg.
You wanna get high.

85
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,603
You're doing, what,
80 milligrams a day?

86
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:13,605
No. That's way too much.

87
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:16,608
Moderation is the key.
Unless there's pain.

88
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:19,110
It's double what you were
taking when I hired you.

89
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:21,043
'Cause you're twice as annoying.

90
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:23,048
I can't always be here
to protect you.

91
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,050
Patients talk.
Doctors talk.

92
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:28,554
About how big
your ass has gotten lately?
Not me. I defend it.

93
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,612
You got back.

94
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:42,061
You can't go a week
without the drugs.
No, I don't wanna go without the drugs.

95
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,069
It'll hurt.
No, you can't.

96
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:47,072
If you're just getting off
pain medication, it will hurt.

97
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,075
You won't be having a great time,
but you'll make it.

98
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,577
If you're detoxing,
you'll have chills, nausea.

99
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:55,239
Your pain
will magnify five, ten times.

100
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:58,249
You won't make it.
Well, I guess we'll never know.

101
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:01,252
I'll give you a week off clinic duty
if you can go a week without narcotics.

102
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,311
No way.
I love the clinic.

103
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:05,983
You love the pills.
Two weeks.

104
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:08,891
The pills don't make me high.
They make me neutral.
A month.

105
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,891
You're on, mister.

106
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:24,170
Drugs could cause this?
Cocaine and meth are very hard
on the blood system.

107
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:28,170
Has he had
any erratic behavior?
No, but--

108
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:32,775
She was in rehab in
the ninth grade.

109
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:35,946
She's supposedly
clean now, but--
She obviously cares for him.

110
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:38,081
Yeah, what she cared about
was the car.

111
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:40,682
Anniversary present for my wife.

112
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,753
We drove it up north
to watch the leaves change.

113
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,765
She was dead a year later.

114
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,301
Cancer.
I'm sorry.

115
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:54,598
Mr. Foster,
we're gonna test Keith for drugs.

116
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,608
I-- I don't do drugs.

117
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:59,406
It's not that
we don't trust you, but--

118
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:04,812
His hair will tell us any drugs
he's taken over the past 60 days.

119
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:07,876
It's kind of like
rings on a tree.

120
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,451
Negative.

121
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:20,163
- Have you been sick?
- No, nothing.

122
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:24,863
- Have you been out of the country?
- We went to China,
but we got all our shots before we left.

123
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:26,871
It could be an infection.

124
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:29,430
We're going to give him
a gallium scan just to be safe.

125
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,478
We inject a radioactive isotope
into his bloodstream,

126
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:35,571
and we check to see if there's
inflammation anywhere in the body.

127
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:38,048
Has he ever complained
of any joint pain?

128
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:40,984
Sensitivity to light?
Rashes?

129
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:44,352
- No, no. Nothing.
- Any relatives who've ever
been diagnosed with lupus?

130
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:46,687
I don't even know what that is.

131
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:49,694
In simple terms,
the body becomes allergic to itself.

132
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:52,856
The immune system attacks
healthy cells in the circulatory system
and destroys them.

133
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:54,923
Would it be treatable?

134
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:58,093
It can be manageable.

135
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:01,105
We can test for the antibodies.

136
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:04,768
Ninety-five percent of patients
with lupus have positive A.N.A.

137
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:08,279
Not cloudy.
Negative.

138
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:12,784
What about bruising?
Never complained of tenderness
under his arms or his groin?

139
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,514
I'm not sure he'd tell me if he did.

140
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:19,080
I guess I don't really know
what's going on in his life.

141
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:21,820
- He's a teenager.
- Yeah.

142
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:28,790
What type of cancer
did your wife have?

143
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:31,702
Pancreatic.

144
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:34,797
It's his lymph nodes
we're concerned about.

145
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:38,310
We're going to do a biopsy
to check for lymphoma.

146
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,977
Can you feel this?
No.

147
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:44,539
Good.

148
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:53,992
I have cancer, don't I?

149
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,620
We're just testing.

150
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:01,462
That's what they told my mom.

151
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,702
Definitely not cancer.

152
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,770
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

153
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:16,508
Negative for drugs.
A.N.A. was negative.
Gallium scan was clear.

154
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:18,516
Yeah, I got that from the "nothing".

155
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:20,848
- Where's his hematocrit?
- Thirteen.

156
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,254
Drops any lower, he's not gonna
have enough red blood cells
to bring oxygen to his body.

157
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:27,519
He'll suffocate with his lungs
working perfectly.
You okay?

158
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:31,725
Excuse me, someone?
Help. Please!

159
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:35,292
Polite for a dying kid.

160
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:40,862
How long has it been?

161
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,874
I'm fine.

162
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:45,467
- There's something in my eye.
Up at the top.
- Which eye?

163
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:47,671
This one.
What's happening?

164
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:49,874
It's all right.
Just look down for me.

165
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:54,379
It's clear.
There's nothing in it.

166
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:56,478
- It's getting worse.
- Is it fuzzy or--

167
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:58,580
No, it's dark.

168
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,950
I can't see.

169
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:17,502
It's a retinal clot in the left eye.

170
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:19,976
Coumadin would dissolve the clot,
fix his eyesight.

171
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:22,981
You can't use blood thinners.
He's got internal bleeding.

172
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:26,348
Fix the eye,
you'd kill everything else.
Surgery's out for the same reason.

173
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:30,048
We have two hours to figure this out.
Either we restore the blood flow,
or he loses the eye.

174
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:36,962
Forget the eye.
Tell him to use the other one
to look on the bright side.

175
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,020
The clot tells us something.

176
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:43,262
Could help us figure out what he has,
which could mean he gets to live.

177
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:46,566
Differential diagnosis, people.

178
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,403
How does internal bleeding
suddenly start clotting?

179
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:52,706
It makes no sense.
They're opposing processes.

180
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:55,645
It can happen in lupus.
Increased platelet count
can cause blood clots.

181
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,047
A.N.A. was negative.
It's not lupus.

182
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:01,416
This is true.
But why are you the one saying it?

183
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:05,548
What are you doing here?
I thought we'd ruled out cancer.

184
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:07,558
I was lonely.

185
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:09,651
Well, go see Cuddy.
She needs a friend.

186
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,061
That's funny.
She said you might need one.

187
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:15,999
That's why you're here.
She wants you to keep an eye on me.
Make sure I don't cheat.

188
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:19,595
No, I wanted to make sure you don't
start firing shots from the clock tower.

189
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:22,106
I'm fine--

190
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:24,108
What's going on?

191
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:26,406
He hasn't had Vicodin
in over a day.

192
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,672
- Does your leg hurt?
- You ever been shot?

193
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:35,118
There's gonna be side effects.
Insomnia, depression, tachycardia.

194
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:37,280
Withdrawal symptoms.
Not applicable.

195
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:41,349
The only side effects
I'm gonna have are some pain
and 30 days of freedom.

196
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,789
Am I the only one who's
concerned about a dying kid?

197
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:49,198
If it's not lupus, what else?

198
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:53,329
Most likely candidate
for throwing a clot
is infection or cancer.

199
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:55,498
Checked the biopsy twice.
It's not cancer.

200
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:58,338
It's not an infection.
Gallium scan didn't reveal anything.

201
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:01,470
Okay.
What hides from a Gallium scan?

202
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,851
Cardiac.
Right.

203
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,913
Clot flicks off, travels through the arteries,
then gets backed up in the eye.

204
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,361
I'm sorry. I wasn't paying attention.
What happened?

205
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:23,993
It's an infection in his heart.

206
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:26,060
Great.

207
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:31,403
Echocardiogram for the heart
and I.V. antibiotics for the infection, stat.

208
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:47,448
Is it my birthday?

209
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:52,491
I'm not lonely.
My leg hurts.

210
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:55,796
- She's a real masseuse.
- She's $500 an hour, minimum.

211
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:59,395
She's hot, so she's a hooker?
What kind of pathetic logic is that?

212
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:03,202
The envious, jealous,
I-never-got-any-in-high-school
kind of logic. Hello!

213
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:05,607
She's a legitimate masseuse.

214
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,669
Come on.

215
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,615
God! She's beautiful.

216
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:14,346
Because she's beautiful, I should do it?
What kind of pathetic logic is that?

217
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:18,789
The envious, jealous,
I'm-married-and-I-can't-do-anything
logic. Hello.

218
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:22,021
Hi. Uh, listen,
I'm sure you're really good at
whatever it is you do, but--

219
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:24,961
Déme su mano.
Huh?

220
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,630
- Hey, no, no. Let go of my hand.
- She doesn't speak English.

221
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,602
Shh.

222
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,869
Ow!

223
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,431
Ow-- Ahh.

224
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:40,910
Ahh.

225
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:46,307
Oh, my God.

226
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:52,780
Bueno.

227
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:55,292
Take off your clothes.

228
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,793
Not a fan of the Stroganoff?

229
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:07,398
I'm not hungry.
Well, the antibiotics
can cause nausea.

230
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:09,464
So can the food.

231
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:13,578
Shouldn't you
be looking at my eye?

232
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,614
The blood clot
isn't life-threatening.

233
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:18,411
We're focusing on figuring out
the cause of your problems.

234
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:22,318
So the-- So the blindness
will be permanent, won't it?

235
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,266
Thank you.
Bye.

236
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,878
I had a massage.

237
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,382
Looks like you had a masseuse.
Help the pain?

238
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,883
I'm fine.
I know.

239
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:56,217
Kid's echo was normal.
No signs of any vegetations
on heart valves.

240
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:59,052
Never met a diagnostic study
I couldn't refute.

241
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,058
And the antibiotics
aren't doing anything.

242
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:04,061
So double the dosage.
70 milligrams.

243
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,063
That'll box his kidneys
for sure.

244
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,065
Oh, you're right.
Save the kidney.

245
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:11,068
The guy we transplant it into
will be grateful.

246
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:14,071
Also, I have an idea
for his eye.
Nothing we can do about his eye.

247
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,505
He's got a clot in the retina--
Put it in a memo.

248
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:19,510
If we remove some of the liquid
from the eye itself,
the vitreous humour,

249
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:22,570
it might make some extra room
around the retinal artery.

250
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:28,315
If the artery expands,
the clot might move on its own.
That's very creative.

251
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,821
Why didn't you mention this
before?

252
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,880
I didn't think of it before.

253
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,290
You should've.

254
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,780
This is going to hurt.

255
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:59,284
Your eye is numb.
You'll only feel pressure.

256
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,702
Give it a minute.

257
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:37,755
I can see.

258
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:08,252
I can see you.

259
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,754
I heard.
Congratulations.

260
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:13,849
Don't. I haven't
brushed my teeth in two days.

261
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,460
I'm so scared
they're not gonna find out
what's wrong with you.

262
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:27,334
No biggie.
I'm fine.

263
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:31,467
I feel so bad about all this.
It's all my fault.

264
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:33,773
No. No, it's not.

265
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:37,805
But your father-- he hates me.

266
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:40,477
He's just pissed about his car.

267
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:49,894
Help! Help! Help!

268
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:01,202
What's wrong?

269
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,798
A.S.T. is 859.
We're getting him to the I.C.U.

270
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:05,844
A.L.T. and G.G.T. are in the tank.
Our antibiotics--

271
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:08,573
Would not have caused this.
She must have given him drugs!

272
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,480
- I wouldn't do that!
- It's not drugs!

273
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,178
His liver is shutting down.
What?

274
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:17,916
What does that mean?
It means he's all better.
He's ready to go home.

275
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,481
What?
What do you think it means?

276
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,027
You can't live without a liver.
He's dying.

277
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:25,723
What is your problem?
Bum leg.
What's yours?

278
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:28,288
Hey, we don't have time for this.
Let's go.

279
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:35,770
His son's dying,
and you're mocking him?

280
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,105
It was a dumb question.

281
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,701
No, it wasn't.

282
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:44,038
You're right. It wasn't.

283
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,217
Is proving Cuddy wrong
worth all this?

284
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:07,668
- You know, House shouldn't even be here.
- Because he said something inappropriate?

285
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:11,334
If we sent him home
every time he did that,
we wouldn't need this office.

286
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:15,779
- He's in pain.
- What does the man
have to do to piss you off?

287
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:18,714
- He's been without pain relief
for over 70 hours.
- Exactly!

288
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:21,275
He's detoxing.
Can't you see
he's out of his mind?

289
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:23,344
That's what they said about Manson.

290
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:27,925
Do you wanna continue
talking about me,

291
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:30,461
or should we discuss
what the liver damage tells us?

292
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:35,623
I was born in a log cabin in Illinois--

293
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:37,635
Hemolytic anemia
doesn't cause liver damage.

294
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:39,568
Add the fact he's coughing blood,

295
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:42,266
you've got three of the indicators
of organ-threatening lupus.

296
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:44,036
It's moving too fast.

297
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,636
Could be hepatitis "E".

298
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:50,409
There's only been one case of hep "E"
originating in the U.S. since--

299
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:54,543
His history says he's been
in and out of the country
four times in the last year.

300
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,383
You really think he's got hep "E"?

301
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:59,049
No.
I think lupus is way more likely.

302
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:01,922
All right, then let's start him
on I.V. cytoxan and plasmapheresis.

303
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:04,758
No, we should rule out hep "E".

304
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,764
You just said it wasn't hep "E".

305
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:09,824
I said lupus is way more likely,
but if we treat for lupus
and it is hep "E"--

306
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:12,597
He's toast.
Exactly.

307
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:14,605
But there isn't a treatment
for hepatitis "E".

308
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:17,335
Either he'll get better on his own
or he'll continue to deteriorate.

309
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:20,936
Yeah. I went to medical school too.

310
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:23,004
Start him on solumedrol.

311
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:27,017
- If he's got hep "E",
that's only gonna make him worse.
- Not as much.

312
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:29,019
It's Goldilocks, people.

313
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:33,547
Won't hurt him so much
that it'll kill him, and it won't hurt him
so little that we can't tell.

314
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,820
It'll hurt him... just right.

315
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:37,828
And if it does nothing--

316
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:41,354
We'll know it's not hep "E"
and can start treating for lupus.

317
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,958
Now watch me do it
while drinking a glass of water.

318
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:48,268
What do we tell the dad?
"We think your kid has lupus,
so we're gonna treat him for hepatitis 'E'.

319
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:52,674
And, oh, yeah, if it really is hep 'E',
we're not actually giving him
hep 'E' medication.

320
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:55,508
So it's gonna make him worse,
not better."
Think he'll go for that?

321
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:59,048
- So you want us to lie?
- No.

322
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:02,018
- I want you to lie.
- Why me?

323
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:04,078
Because he trusts you.

324
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:09,660
- This is a mistake.
- This is a lawsuit.

325
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:11,662
Hep "E" is possible.

326
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:14,164
House always pulls these stunts,
and he's right more often--

327
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:18,032
He's delaying treatment because
of a one-in-a-million chance that
even he doesn't think is the problem.

328
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:20,037
I don't wanna lie to him.
Then don't.

329
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:23,040
And get fired?
Oh, like he's gonna fire you.
He loves you.

330
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:25,372
I've gotta do something.

331
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:28,379
- Kid needs treatment.
- Treat him for lupus.

332
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:30,540
That will get you fired.

333
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,674
You really think House
is losing it?

334
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:35,913
Yeah.

335
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,846
He's fine.
He knows what he's doing.

336
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,740
Okay.

337
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:43,383
We're recommending
a drug called solumedrol.

338
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:48,017
For hepatitis?
Did that show up
on his blood tests?

339
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:52,463
The tests
are never 100% accurate.

340
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:55,261
Well, then all the other tests
could be wrong too.

341
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:58,268
This could still be an infection
or cancer.
Um--

342
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:01,271
They don't fit any of
the most recent symptoms.

343
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:04,137
Well, what, just hepatitis does?

344
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:07,872
I know, I know, I know--
you can never be sure.

345
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:13,841
When Wendy was in the hospital,

346
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:18,120
a doctor told us
there was this aggressive
experimental treatment...

347
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:21,591
which might extend her life
by two or three years.

348
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:27,155
Well, we figured if there was any hope
at all that we could have her with us
a little while longer, it'd be worth it.

349
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:31,325
Three weeks later, she was gone.

350
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:36,764
I don't think it's hepatitis.

351
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:41,438
I think your son has lupus.

352
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:45,382
I think it's broken.

353
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,441
What did you do?

354
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:51,388
Accidentally
closed the car door on it.

355
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,651
No.
Door would've broken the skin.

356
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:58,321
This looks like something
hard and smooth smashed it.

357
00:24:58,396 --> 00:25:00,330
I want my lawyer.

358
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:03,333
The brain has
a gating mechanism for pain.

359
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:06,962
Registers the most severe injury
and blocks out the others.

360
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:10,371
Did it work?
Well, my hand hurts like hell.

361
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:14,978
Yeah. I feel much better.
Huh.

362
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:17,981
Don't splint it.

363
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:22,486
I want to be able to
bang it against the wall if I need to
administer another dose.

364
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:25,250
Just tape it up.

365
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:31,928
Why did you tell Cameron
to lie to Mr. Foster?

366
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:34,158
Make it tight.
Answer me.

367
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:39,203
Nothing I can say
is gonna change how you feel,

368
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:42,206
and nothing can come out of
your reaction that is gonna change
what I plan to do,

369
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:44,208
so I prefer to say nothing.

370
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:46,710
So that was just you
saying nothing.

371
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:48,712
Uh-huh.

372
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,840
- The guy is furious.
- And scared.

373
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:54,852
So what are you gonna do?
The father's insisting
on the lupus treatment.

374
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,287
Yeah, Cameron told me,
and I told her to tell him no.

375
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:01,291
Well, you can't just sit back
and let the kid die.

376
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:03,520
Neither can the father.
So that's your plan?

377
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:05,620
You're gonna play chicken
with the kid's life?

378
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:08,530
Well, he's the dad.
I should win easily.

379
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,966
Take the week off.

380
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:13,470
Why, 'cause I lied to a patient?

381
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:15,972
I take risks.
Sometimes patients die.

382
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:18,976
But not taking risks
causes more patients to die,

383
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:22,241
so I guess my biggest problem is
I've been cursed
with the ability to do the math.

384
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:28,410
I told him that we wouldn't
treat him for the lupus until--

385
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:32,081
- What'd he say?
- He said he wanted to transfer Keith
to another hospital.

386
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:35,126
He's not stable enough.
He'd never make it through the door.
That's what I told him.

387
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:37,821
And that's when he caved.

388
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:41,059
Yeah.
He agreed to do it your way.

389
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:43,896
Two plus two equals four.

390
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:53,303
If it is hepatitis "E",
we should see a marked decline
in liver function tests within the hour.

391
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:56,313
Why bother explaining it to me?
It's not like I have any choice
in the matter.

392
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:59,077
If there's no hep "E",
we'll start treatment for lupus immediately.

393
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,084
Ouch.

394
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:03,143
- Keith? What's wrong?
- What's happening?

395
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:05,155
No, get off.

396
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:08,681
Keith, it's Dr. Chase.
Where does it hurt?
Jules, no!

397
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,853
- He's hallucinating.
- Is this from the medicine?

398
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:14,421
- We haven't started the medicine.
- Keith, you're in the hospital.
Keith, there's nothing on you.

399
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:17,866
- Hey. Hey. Keith.
- Keith! Keith! Keith!

400
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:20,461
Hey. You okay, buddy?

401
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:28,936
Um, I think I wet the bed.

402
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:33,007
Oh--
Don't worry about it.
It's fine. Let's get you up.

403
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:37,651
- Oh, God!
- He's had a major bleed.

404
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:41,488
- Bright red blood per rectum.
- I didn't-- I didn't mean to. I'm sorry.

405
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:43,527
He's going into
hypovolemic shock.

406
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:47,656
- Pressure's 60, heart rate's 140.
- We need an angiography, stat!

407
00:27:57,609 --> 00:28:00,544
Angiography revealed
major upper and lower G.I. bleeding,

408
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:03,376
severe hemodynamic
compromise and liver failure.

409
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:06,940
He's also hallucinating.
Thinks he's being tortured by
someone named Jules.

410
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,952
Hallucinations
are a symptom of psychosis,

411
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,454
which is the fourth
diagnostic criterion.

412
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,457
It's official. This is lupus.

413
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:16,460
Who's Jules?

414
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,860
Any mention of her
in the medical history?

415
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:22,388
It doesn't matter
what he's hallucinating about,
it matters why! It's lupus.

416
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:24,401
Well, there's no need
to get snippy.

417
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:27,029
This kind of lupus takes years
to get to this point.

418
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:28,504
It's been a week.
Yeah.

419
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:32,703
And a 16-year-old kid
shouldn't have hemolytic anemia
or be bleeding out of every orifice, but he is.

420
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:37,714
We had an opportunity to treat this.
Instead, we diddled around
with hepatitis "E", and now it's too late.

421
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:40,546
He needs a new liver.
We screwed up.

422
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:43,519
You're saying I screwed up.

423
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:47,689
- Yes.
- Then why don't you just say that?

424
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:52,886
- You gonna blame this on her?
- Did you agree with my recommendation
to treat for hep "E"?

425
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:56,195
- No, I didn't.
- And she made herself quite clear.

426
00:28:56,267 --> 00:29:00,033
- And then she went and lied to the father.
That's why you're angry.
- Yeah. I trusted you.

427
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:03,666
You always trust me.
That's a big mistake.

428
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,767
Lupus is a bad diagnosis.

429
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:08,438
- It's the best diagnosis we've got.
- That doesn't make it good.

430
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:11,949
No. It just makes it
this kid's only chance to live.

431
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:19,015
Put him on the transplant list.

432
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,285
And make sure Cuddy knows.

433
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:24,351
See if she can do anything
to get him close to the top.

434
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:49,986
Cafeteria.

435
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:51,988
Stay away from the sushi.

436
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:54,081
And what happened to your hand?

437
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:58,419
Got stuck in a drawer.

438
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:00,987
Yeah, right.
You're going through withdrawal.

439
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:04,762
No, I am going through pain.

440
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:07,771
Pain causes nausea.

441
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:11,935
I took this job to work with you,
not cover your ass.

442
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:14,902
Your Vicodin.

443
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:20,579
And your solution
is to give me drugs.

444
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,586
That's interesting.
No.

445
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,987
Now I'm covering my ass.

446
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:28,685
Take your pills
before you kill this kid.

447
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,967
Lupus is normally treated
with medication.

448
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:13,697
But in Keith's case,
the disease is too advanced.

449
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:18,731
Because you lied.
Because House wanted to
play games with my son's life.

450
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:22,007
There's no way to really tell what
progression the disease may have taken--
You're right.

451
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:26,676
And I'm sorry.

452
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,583
So what do we do?

453
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:32,589
He needs a new liver.

454
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:37,094
There are over 15,000 patients
on the transplant list.

455
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:40,028
But how many
are about to bleed to death
unless they get a new liver?

456
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:42,566
In Jersey? I'd say, uh, 20.

457
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:47,228
Two thousand patients die each year
because a donor liver can't be found.
That's almost five a day.

458
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:49,000
So he's screwed.

459
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:52,840
I'll see what I can do.

460
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:58,241
- Could I donate part of my liver?
- Sorry. You're a different blood type.

461
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:00,443
So we just wait?
I'm afraid so.

462
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:02,782
And hope for someone to die.

463
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:06,947
Who's Jules?

464
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:11,522
Dr. House, you should
get back to your office--
Jules.

465
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:14,963
- There's no Jules in the history.
- It was a hallucination.

466
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:16,967
Of what?
Our cat.

467
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:19,469
Does this matter?
No. I'm sorry.

468
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:23,564
We'll continue the transfusions and
the treatment for the anemia and liver failure
while we're waiting for a donor.

469
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:26,906
- How long can he wait?
- Not long.

470
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:29,208
- I don't think this is lupus.
- It's lupus. Come on, let's just go--

471
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,215
Your fourth diagnostic criterion
for lupus is psychosis.

472
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,615
This is just a kid
missing his cat.

473
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:37,951
He was being attacked by an animal
that wasn't in the room.

474
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:41,219
That's psychosis.
There's a difference between
psychosis and hallucination.

475
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:44,728
So if he was imagining a fake cat,
it'd be lupus, but since it
was a real cat, it's not?

476
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,821
- Take your damn pills.
- Psychosis requires--

477
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:48,957
There is no cat.

478
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:52,265
Jules is dead.

479
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:57,999
You have a dead family pet
and you never mentioned it?

480
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:00,067
Nice family history.

481
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:04,274
Family history's
asking about family members,
meaning people related to the patient.

482
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:07,113
How did the cat die?
Can you get him outta here?

483
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:10,746
- Dr. House, come on, let's--
- What happened to the cat?

484
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:13,981
Old age.

485
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:15,958
- She was 15 years old.
- When?

486
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:17,756
About a month ago.

487
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:20,127
- Does this have anything to do with--
- Where'd she sleep?

488
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:22,029
With Keith.
This is not a cat allergy.

489
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,965
And it's not lupus.

490
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:26,003
Where is Jules?

491
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:33,510
Four years of college,

492
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:35,512
four at med school,

493
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,514
two years of residency,

494
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:40,517
another four
of subspecialty training,
and where do I end up?

495
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,154
Talking instead of digging.

496
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:46,383
Come on.
The ground's frozen solid.

497
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:58,565
What's that?

498
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,021
Out of the way!

499
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:54,924
We have the liver.
Prep O.R. four.

500
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:24,614
All right, Keith,
start counting backward from ten.

501
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:26,680
Ten,

502
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:29,626
nine,

503
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:32,322
eight--

504
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:34,694
Scalpel.

505
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,235
Stop the gases.

506
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,773
What the hell are you doing,
House?

507
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:49,108
Saving a 16-year-old kid from a lifetime
of immunosuppressant drugs
and a very nasty scar.

508
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,774
This kid doesn't have
lupoid hepatitis.

509
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:53,840
He has acute naphthalene toxicity.

510
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:57,115
Naphthalene?
Y-Y-You're talking about mothballs.

511
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:58,917
Nope. Termites.

512
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:02,125
They create naphthalene
to protect their nests,

513
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:07,324
which I'm assuming is rather large
and inside all four walls of his bedroom at home.

514
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:10,867
And your assumption
is based on what?

515
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:14,132
The autopsy I just conducted
on his pet cat.

516
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:17,971
- Call Cuddy. And Security.
- You are not removing that kid's liver.

517
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:19,805
Now!

518
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:26,642
Have you completely lost your mind?

519
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:29,447
No, but I have been feeling
a little sick lately.

520
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,011
Ah-choo!

521
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:37,223
There's no way
we can do this surgery now.
Ya think?

522
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:40,162
You've already cost him his liver.
Don't kill him too.

523
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:43,166
Why are you so eager
to cut into a healthy kid?

524
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:46,169
Healthy? He's in the toilet.
He just needs
some chicken soup.

525
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:50,196
- I'm telling Hourani to re-scrub.
We're doing this transplant.
- No, you're not.

526
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:54,643
You said it. If Keith's symptoms had
an environmental cause, they would have
disappeared as soon as he got here.

527
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,202
They've only gotten worse.

528
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,807
If the food here wasn't
one step below Riker's Island,
he would've gotten better.

529
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,512
- He's lost 14 pounds--
- Sure. This is nothing but a dietary thing.

530
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:05,215
Naphthalene is a gas,
a fat-soluble gas.

531
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:08,224
Kid breathes it in,
it gets stored in his fat cells.

532
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:11,591
Outside the hospital, his body
burned protein and carbs for energy.

533
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:13,425
And the naphthalene
stayed in fat.

534
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:18,264
But once the car accident
put him in the hospital
and he started losing weight,

535
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:20,634
his body had to get its energy
somewhere else.

536
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:23,299
It started to burn fat.

537
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:24,306
The floodgates opened.

538
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:27,435
The poison poured into his system.

539
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:29,945
So getting away from the poison
is what poisoned him?

540
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:32,949
Getting away from his dad's meat loaf
is what's killing him.

541
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:35,679
You wanna explain to me
why you stopped the surgery?

542
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,744
Oh, my God!
My God.

543
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:42,248
- I want him locked up!
- Hey!

544
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:44,419
Take it easy.

545
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:58,131
Your cat did not die of old age.

546
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:04,737
It died of massive internal bleeding
and acute liver failure...

547
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:06,908
caused by naphthalene poisoning.

548
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:10,813
The exact same thing
your son has.

549
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:14,483
You lie to me,
you mess up my son's surgery,
and now you expect me to trust you?

550
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:17,994
Give me 24 hours.
We'll pump your son full of calories--

551
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:21,156
- That liver is going to somebody right now.
- We're doing that surgery.

552
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:25,100
You do the surgery,
you'll be killing a mother of four.

553
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:26,932
Father of three.

554
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:29,768
- I was guessing.
- Like you are now?

555
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:35,406
Naphthalene poisoning
is the best explanation we have
for what's wrong with your son.

556
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,813
It explains the internal bleeding,
the hemolytic anemia,
the liver failure.

557
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:42,284
It also predicts what'll happen next.

558
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:46,414
If you do the surgery,
he's gonna lay on that table
for 14 hours...

559
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:50,256
while his body continues to burn fat
and release poison into his system.

560
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,990
Either way, I did you a favor.

561
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:56,090
He's awake now.
You've got a chance to say good-bye.

562
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:05,665
I think you should trust Dr. House.

563
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:21,221
Give the liver to the other guy.

564
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,605
Watch out.

565
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:02,430
I.N.R.'s down
and his red count is climbing.

566
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,393
Means you made the right call.

567
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:10,167
His liver is healing.
He's gonna be just fine.

568
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:29,625
You made it a week.

569
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:31,627
And won my prize.

570
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:33,629
Congratulations.
Cuddy's a sucker.

571
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:36,131
I would've done it
for two weeks off.

572
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,134
Yeah, it was a piece of cake.

573
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:39,635
You learn anything?

574
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:42,563
Yeah.

575
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,631
I'm an addict.

576
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,276
Uh--

577
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,286
Okay.

578
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:01,847
I'm not stopping.

579
00:41:04,361 --> 00:41:06,295
There are programs.

580
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:08,297
Cuddy would give you the time.

581
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:11,493
You could get on a different
pain management regimen.
I don't need to stop.

582
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:14,771
You just said--

583
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:18,900
I said I was an addict.
I didn't say I had a problem.

584
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:21,069
I pay my bills. I make my meals.
I function.

585
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:26,178
Is that all you want?
You have no relationships.

586
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,616
I don't want any relationships.

587
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:32,122
- You alienate people.
- I've been alienating people
since I was three.

588
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:34,623
Oh, come on!
Drop it.

589
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:37,160
You don't think you've changed
in the last few years?

590
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:40,459
Well, ofcourse I have.
I've-- I've gotten older,
my hair's got thinner.

591
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:44,433
Sometimes I'm bored.
Sometimes I'm lonely.
Sometimes I wonder what it all means.

592
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,867
No, I was there.

593
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:48,598
You are not just a regular guy
who's getting older.

594
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:51,539
You've changed. You're miserable,
and you're afraid to face yourself.

595
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:54,271
Ofcourse I've changed!

596
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:03,878
And everything's the leg?

597
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:06,946
Nothing's the pills?
They haven't done a thing to you?

598
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:11,459
They let me do my job.

599
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:14,157
And they take away my pain.

600
00:42:45,629 --> 00:42:48,063
How'd it go?

601
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:50,566
He admitted
he's addicted to the narcotics.

602
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:54,126
Well, admitting you
have a problem is the first--
And he says it's not a problem.

603
00:42:55,472 --> 00:42:57,406
Maybe it's not.

604
00:42:57,474 --> 00:42:59,408
What do I know?

605
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:02,741
What are you gonna do?
Nothing.
Done enough damage.

606
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:06,749
Better hope he never finds out
that that was your idea.
He'd never believe it.
