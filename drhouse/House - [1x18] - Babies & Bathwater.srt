1
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:08,169
Did I say anything stupid?

2
00:00:09,642 --> 00:00:12,076
I had two drinks.

3
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:15,104
Three.

4
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:17,206
Okay. Yeah.
There was that last one also.
Mm-hmm.

5
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:21,743
It's okay.
Someday you'll be pregnant,
and you can return the favor.

6
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:28,259
I feel like such a idiot sometimes.
Oh.

7
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:31,593
You know, when the baby comes,
I am gonna be--

8
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:34,963
You know what?
You're gonna be so great.

9
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,798
You are.

10
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,839
Mmm.

11
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:48,607
Hey!

12
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:55,120
You all right?

13
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:57,383
Uh-- Uh-huh.

14
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:59,425
Oh, no.

15
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:09,368
You know why
I pulled you over?
I'm-- I'm so sorry, Officer.

16
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:12,667
I must have, uh, dozed off.
Have you been drinking?

17
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,764
No.
Ofcourse she hasn't.

18
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:19,370
- Somebody has.
- I've been drinking.

19
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:22,142
You all right?
Uh, I'm-- I'm-- I'm not, uh--

20
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:25,946
How far along are you?
Uh, almost--

21
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:28,510
Ma'am, step out of the vehicle.

22
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:35,427
Ma'am, walk to the rear of the car.

23
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:37,463
Naomi. Are--

24
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:41,432
Naomi?

25
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,362
- Naomi.
- Sir, remain in the car.

26
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,998
Hey, listen.
She's not drunk.
I will arrest you, sir.

27
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:50,372
- She's sick! Look at her.
- Can you roll me another unit?

28
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,468
Get back in the car.

29
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,547
Naomi! Get off.

30
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:58,878
Call an ambulance.

31
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:34,986
The good news is
it doesn't look like a stroke.

32
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:37,079
No bleeds, no clots.

33
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,387
Thank God.
It sounds like
there's bad news.

34
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:42,121
We got your blood work back.
Some things are a little off.

35
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:44,186
Your liver and kidneys
aren't working so well.

36
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:47,563
Why? What would cause that?
It's preeclampsia, isn't it?

37
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:51,764
- I'm gonna miscarry, aren't I?
- Preeclampsia is a possibility.
But let's not get ahead of ourselves.

38
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,772
I've miscarried three times.
I'm 39.

39
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,741
We had to use in vitro. You've
gotta make sure the baby's okay.

40
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:59,243
Let's make sure that
you're okay first.

41
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:02,475
How about we take care of
both of you at the same time?

42
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:06,610
The nurse will be in soon
to take some blood.
I'd like to run some more tests.

43
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,984
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Thank you.

44
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,882
Where is everybody?
No one's in the office?

45
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,123
No. I haven't heard from
Cameron all day.
You seen House?

46
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,098
Look for a shallow grave
with Vogler standing over it.

47
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:28,632
You have a stage IV cancer.

48
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,310
It's metastasized to your liver.

49
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:41,410
There's a new drug called
8C12 that's shown promise
in Phase II trials.

50
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:44,081
It's your best shot.

51
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:46,990
Thank you, Doctor.

52
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,654
You've been so good to me and--

53
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,095
Well, I-- I did...

54
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,599
publicly bash
your company's drug.

55
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,965
When I think about
how I treated you--

56
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:59,368
Oh, hey. Come on.

57
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:05,002
There, there, there.

58
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:11,976
So, um, there is some hope.

59
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:14,212
Always.

60
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:17,381
But just in case, I special-ordered
an extra-jumbo-sized coffin.

61
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:20,255
Hey.

62
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:23,124
Don't thank me.
It's just who I am.

63
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,187
Hey!

64
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,665
Up and at 'em, big guy.

65
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:34,137
Sorry. Up late.
Internet porn.

66
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:35,902
How come you're not
in your office?

67
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:39,411
Because there is a computer in my office,
and if I log on, romance will ensue.

68
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:43,210
- My wrist might fall off.
- Hiding 'cause Vogler's
looking for you, huh?

69
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,217
That's just pathetic.

70
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:49,688
I don't like loud, angry giants
threatening me with violence.
How is that pathetic?

71
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:52,554
You think you can avoid
firing one of us
by hiding out here?

72
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,559
He'll find you sooner or later.

73
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,561
I'm okay with later.

74
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:59,257
39-year-old female,
28 weeks pregnant.

75
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:02,733
- G, four. P, zero.
- Three miscarriages?

76
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:06,663
Gimme.
Altered mental status and
complete loss of coordination.

77
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:09,902
Tox screen?
Negative for alcohol and drugs.

78
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,240
She was on oxybutynin.
For incontinence.

79
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:16,510
Yeah. Well, we took her off.
No change. B.U.N. and creatinine
are up. L.F.T.'s slightly elevated.

80
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:21,042
Preeclampsia.
Call the OB-GYN service
and rub some prayer beads.

81
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,285
- B.P.'s normal.
No preeclampsia in other pregnancies.
- Because she didn't carry for long enough.

82
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:29,419
The three miscarriages
make me think
it's an underlying physiology.

83
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,760
Pregnancy-related autoimmunity.

84
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,231
Too bad that Cameron quit.

85
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:39,135
We could use
an immunologist right now.

86
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:42,902
- We'll see if you're right.
Check the blood.
- Cameron quit?

87
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:45,068
Last night.

88
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:47,738
And do an M.R.A. for vasculitis too.

89
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:50,442
There's no way she quit.

90
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,076
She got fired because
you couldn't swallow your pride.

91
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:55,780
An ultrasound?
Excellent thought.

92
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:59,256
And put her on magnesium too,
in case it is preeclampsia.

93
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:02,788
Sure.

94
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:18,139
Here, pussy, pussy, pussy.

95
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,543
I didn't do anything.
Exactly my point.

96
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:22,979
You wanted me to yell at him?

97
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:26,951
What would that have achieved?
Was he gonna jump into his
time machine and fix everything?

98
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:31,683
When a dog dumps on the floor,
do you pat its head? No. You smack it
in the nose with a newspaper.

99
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:34,249
Dogs can learn things.
House can't.

100
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:36,761
Coward.
Child.

101
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:38,820
Hey, there.

102
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:43,127
I, uh, brought
my colleague along to help out.
Hi. I'm Dr. Chase.

103
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:44,430
Hi.

104
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:52,009
Well, ultrasound looks good.
No sign of fetal distress.

105
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,012
So it's not preeclampsia?

106
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,913
Well, it still could be,
but it hasn't progressed at least.

107
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:59,611
We're gonna put you on
bed rest and monitor the baby.

108
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:03,348
Okay.
We'll give you some potassium
and magnesium as well.

109
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,152
We should keep
the fluids running...

110
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:08,455
and check her again in an hour
unless there are signs of fetal distress.
Honey?

111
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,792
She's choking!

112
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:13,195
Lean forward.

113
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,700
- Is she all right?
- Probably just some muscle weakness.

114
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:18,293
- What do you mean "probably"?
- Naomi, open up.

115
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:20,635
People choke.
It could be nothing.

116
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,710
You all right?

117
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:30,940
I can't-- I can't--
I can't even swallow.

118
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:36,244
She gets sick a lot.

119
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:39,485
Like this-- this cold got
really bad all of a sudden.

120
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,527
And the fever--

121
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:44,119
Shh. It's okay.

122
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:47,166
It's not a cold. It's pneumonia.

123
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:52,102
- Pneumonia?
- Relax. Pneumonia's her
second biggest problem.

124
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:58,342
She has gone from
the 25th weight percentile
to the third in one month.

125
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:01,903
I'm not a baby expert,
but I'm pretty sure
they're not supposed to shrink.

126
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:05,109
Well, there's this diet
we put her on when
she stopped breast-feeding.

127
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:07,550
But it's healthy. Um, raw food.
We're vegans.

128
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,850
Almond milk, tofu, uh, vegetables.

129
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:11,856
Raw food.

130
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:14,620
If only her ancestors
had mastered the secret of fire.

131
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:20,064
Babies need fat, proteins, calories.
Less important, sprouts and hemp.

132
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:24,296
Starving babies is bad--
and illegal in many cultures.

133
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,396
- I'm having her admitted.
- Is she gonna be all right?

134
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:31,102
Antibiotics for the pneumonia,
I.V. feeding to get the weight up.

135
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,372
Don't worry.
It's a vegan I.V.

136
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:46,951
Don't see any signs of vasculitis.

137
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,960
Odd.

138
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,962
Since you're always
right about everything.

139
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,964
Could be a different autoimmunity.

140
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,966
Or you could bite me.

141
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,594
Oh, no.

142
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:01,970
- Naomi, you okay?
- No. I can't-- I'm getting cramps.

143
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:07,243
Strong?
Oh. Yeah. Feels like
my miscarriage.

144
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:09,474
Stop.
Preterm labor.

145
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,517
He's too little.
He won't survive.

146
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:13,677
She's on magnesium already.
Fluids and terbutaline then.

147
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:16,813
- We're gonna give you some medicine, okay?
Try to stop your labor.
- Okay.

148
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,413
Okay.

149
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,878
Oh! Ah.

150
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,008
There you are.
Been looking everywhere for you.

151
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:49,384
Uh, listen, you said that
I had to cut one of my people...

152
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:51,753
if I didn't give that speech
about your drug.

153
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:55,521
And, uh, in fairness
to your point of view,

154
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,894
my speech really wasn't
the one you had in mind,
so I've cut Cameron.

155
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:03,230
Now we're all squared away, right?

156
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:07,598
In the morning, I expect you...

157
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:10,039
in my office
with your letter of resignation...

158
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,475
and plans for a public apology,

159
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,740
otherwise I'll destroy you.

160
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,015
So, that's a no
on us being squared away?

161
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,824
She might make it to full term.

162
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:38,301
Contractions are less frequent
and not well organized.

163
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:41,807
Great to see you back in the office.
I guess Vogler found you?

164
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:44,308
Yeah. We had a nice little chat.

165
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:47,710
I really should have kept Cameron.

166
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,011
- She knew where to find the sugar.
- It's what I said: preeclampsia.

167
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:54,109
- A little stress from the M.R.A.,
she pops right into labor.
- Aha.

168
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:58,918
- What about the myasthenia?
- Come on. She didn't seem that weak.

169
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,754
She choked.
She couldn't even swallow.

170
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,158
- What did she choke on?
- Her food.

171
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:06,596
But muscle weakness isn't
a symptom of preeclampsia.

172
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:10,033
- What kind of food?
- A little bit of cooked pear.
Doesn't matter. Shows weakness.

173
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:12,366
She choked on soft, wet pear?

174
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:14,463
Did she forget to take the bones out?

175
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,474
That's way past muscle weakness.

176
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:21,673
- Did you do an upper endoscopy?
- You think there's something
obstructing her esophagus?

177
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:25,945
- We gotta talk.
- Ooh. We gotta talk.

178
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:30,887
And check her eyelids.

179
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:32,981
Check her eyelids?

180
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:38,258
Special board meeting today.
Only one item on the agenda: you.

181
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,525
Enjoy the bagels.
I'm untouchable.

182
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:42,965
Right.

183
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:47,165
Any vote to revoke my tenure
has to be unanimous. I've got
you and maybe even Cuddy.

184
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,537
Well, that settles it.
Mr. Ruthless Corporate Raider...

185
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:53,203
will be totally stymied,
go home, curl up on the floor
of his shower and weep.

186
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,213
What can he do?
I got a contract.

187
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:57,215
Does it say how much
your team is paid,

188
00:11:57,283 --> 00:12:00,343
where you parking space is,
if your car should be
filled with horse manure?

189
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:04,048
Vogler's smart.
He's got some plan to get you.

190
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:07,217
Does it involve candy?
'Cause I'm a sucker for chocolates.

191
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:21,663
- She's doing better.
- Oh, thank God.

192
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:25,905
Technically, Alexander Fleming.
He developed antibiotics.

193
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:28,003
Pneumonia's under control.

194
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,878
From now on, what say
you go with human food, okay?

195
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:34,886
- Absolutely. Swear to God.
- This time, that's your guy.

196
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:38,222
Rachel and Joel Kaplan?

197
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,349
Yes?
You're under arrest.

198
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,860
You have the right
to remain silent.
What did we do?

199
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,953
You're being charged
with child endangerment.

200
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:48,193
- What? How?
-Starving your kid.
I'm from Social Services.

201
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,462
We're taking responsibility
for your baby.

202
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,100
This is how Vogler's
gonna destroy me?

203
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:03,205
- What did he do? Grease your cane?
- He had my patients arrested.

204
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,772
Uh, no. He didn't. I did.

205
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,717
The nurses were concerned,
and they called me.

206
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:12,417
There was evidence of abuse.
You took a big legal risk
by not calling Social Services.

207
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:14,823
Those parents are not abusive.
They're idiots.

208
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,794
Oh, well, that's certainly a relief.

209
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:19,490
It was my call.
You made the wrong one.

210
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:24,233
You know, there's
a new biography of Quisling.
I think you might like it.

211
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,998
Sure. No idea who that is.

212
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:29,302
Uh, Norwegian guy,
World War II, traitor.

213
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:33,334
- The fact that I have to explain this
takes the edge off my flow.
- I was protecting you.

214
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:35,778
From what?
Cops aren't gonna bust me.

215
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:38,408
Disciplinary Committee maybe
gives me a slap on the wrist.

216
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,146
And Vogler has an excuse
to get rid of you.

217
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,417
If I don't give him one,
he makes one up.
Vogler's just one vote.

218
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,152
He's gotta convince the other 11 of us.

219
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:50,992
I'm just trying to stop you
from making that extra easy.

220
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:59,837
Dr. Charles, dial 4541.

221
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:03,739
Sean, do your wife's eyelids
look any different than usual?

222
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:07,969
Uh, maybe one is
drooping a little bit,

223
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:11,175
but, you know, she's tired, so--

224
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:17,220
Naomi, can you
open your mouth for me
and, um, tilt your head back?

225
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,655
This is gonna be
a little uncomfortable.

226
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:29,400
Yeah. There's swelling,
indenting the esophagus.

227
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,026
Is that why she choked?

228
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:34,732
- We'll need to do an X-ray.
- What? No. The baby.
You said no X-rays.

229
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:36,365
It's important.

230
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,910
She has a three-centimeter mass...

231
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:40,912
in her right upper lobe.

232
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,349
Maybe it's a granuloma.
No. There's no calcification.

233
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:55,057
It's small-cell lung cancer.

234
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:57,960
The tumor's starting to press
against your esophagus.

235
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:02,592
It hasn't metastasized,
but it has spread to other parts
of your lung, so we can't operate.

236
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:05,034
Wait. That doesn't make sense.

237
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:07,800
She had, uh, kidney failure
and brain problems.

238
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:12,537
Some cancer patients
get what are called
paraneoplastic syndromes.

239
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:15,375
You were making antibodies
to fight the tumor.

240
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:17,574
They got sidetracked
and attacked other cells.

241
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:21,279
Your brain first.
Then your liver, kidneys.

242
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:23,685
Even the nerves
that control your eyelids.

243
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:27,624
That's called Lambert-Eaton syndrome.
It told us the tumor was in the lungs.

244
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:32,194
How bad is it?

245
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:37,967
Small-cell is the most aggressive
kind of lung cancer.

246
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:42,701
The five-year survival rate
is only about 10% to 15%.

247
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:47,376
Which is why we have to start you
on chemo and radiation right away.

248
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:51,109
- Radiation? What about the baby?
- You'll need a C-section
before you can start the treatment.

249
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:53,651
I can get you in
first thing tomorrow morning.

250
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,983
What are the chances
my baby will survive?

251
00:15:56,055 --> 00:16:00,151
Pretty good.
Twenty-eight weeks, so about 80%.

252
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,952
No, wait.
That's one-in-five chance he'll die?

253
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:07,155
I really wouldn't advise waiting.

254
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:12,397
- Naomi, you gotta
start this treatment right away.
- What happens if I wait?

255
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:18,137
Well, 29 weeks,
the survival rate is closer to 90%.

256
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:23,777
I'm not doing the radiation.
But you'll die if--

257
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:26,044
Listen. You know the chances.
They're nothing.

258
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:28,279
But a few more weeks
will save the baby.

259
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:33,087
Listen. You're depressed right now,
and you're not thinking right, so--

260
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:36,025
Could you j--
Tell her, please.

261
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:40,395
This cancer moves quick.
The median survival's two to four months.

262
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:46,301
If you postpone-- even for a week--

263
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,444
I'm sorry, honey.

264
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:03,412
As most of you know, Gregory House
recently gave a speech about me.

265
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:05,514
I'd like to return the favor.

266
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:07,889
- Sorry.
- Dr. Wilson.

267
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:11,158
I was hoping you were
gonna miss this one.

268
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:18,560
A man is the sum of his actions.
Here are a few of Dr. House's.

269
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:23,904
He violated a D.N.R.
and was charged with assault.

270
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:28,913
He brought a termite into the O.R.
and spat on a surgeon.

271
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:33,179
He accepted a Corvette from a patient
who was a known member
of the New Jersey Mafia.

272
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,015
- Ed, look--
- Edward.

273
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:39,080
Edward. You look at anyone's career,
you can find things that are--

274
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:40,853
These are the last three months.

275
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:46,489
He's personally had
more complaints filed against him
than any department in this hospital.

276
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:50,228
Okay. He's screwed-up.
He's miserable.

277
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:55,069
And he should probably reread
the ethics code, but it works for him.
He's saved hundreds of lives.

278
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,507
He is a drug addict
who flaunts his addiction
and refuses to get treatment.

279
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:02,069
He is a disgrace
and an embarrassment
to this hospital.

280
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:06,479
I'd go on,
but it gets kind of mean, so--

281
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:08,520
I'm gonna keep this simple.

282
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,521
House goes or I go.

283
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:16,221
- You shouldn't personalize this.
- And by "I", I mean
my hundred million dollars.

284
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,255
How's that for personalizing?

285
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,370
You gave us that money
for a reason.

286
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:29,236
Are you really willing
to throw it all away
because of one doctor?

287
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:34,575
Gregory House is a symbol
of everything wrong
with the health care industry.

288
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:37,547
Waste. Insubordination.

289
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:42,315
Doctors preening like
they're kings, and the hospital is
their own private fiefdom.

290
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:46,118
Health care is a business.
I'm gonna run it like one.

291
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,690
I hereby move to revoke
the tenure of Dr. Gregory House...

292
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:53,492
and terminate his employment
at this hospital, effective immediately.

293
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:56,125
- Don't you think we should discuss this?
- We just did.

294
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:58,601
- We need time--
- The vote is on the table.
All in favor?

295
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:34,964
Dr. Wilson.
Opposed.

296
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,304
The motion is defeated.

297
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:41,542
Dr. Wilson, would you mind
leaving the room, please?

298
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:44,309
- Excuse me?
- We're going to take another vote.

299
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:49,544
Well, first of all,
you can't void my vote
by making me stand in the hallway.

300
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:52,351
And second,
you should check the bylaws.

301
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:55,860
You need notice
and at least one business day
before you can reconsider any matter.

302
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:59,625
We're voting on a different matter,
which you are conflicted out of.

303
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,859
How can I be conflicted?

304
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:04,732
This vote is whether
to dismiss Dr. James Wilson.

305
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,862
Naomi is refusing
to have the C-section.

306
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:45,341
Her odds aren't good enough.

307
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:49,278
They do suck.
Where's Wilson?

308
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:52,181
Paged him twice.
She does this,
she knows she's gonna die.

309
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:57,245
She's saving her child.
Cameron would point out
that people are capable of sacrifice.

310
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:59,517
Cameron isn't here.

311
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:03,357
- Perhaps proving her point.
- You think this woman
is making a rational decision?

312
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:06,295
I think people can overcome
their baser drives.

313
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:08,731
Pretty damn rarely.

314
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,564
And not this time.
This is purely biological.

315
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:15,232
In evolutionary terms,
the needs of the next generation
are more important.

316
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:18,765
- You're saying she's making the right call?
- Darwin is. I'm not.

317
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:21,438
The next generation is not my patient.

318
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:25,210
We have to raise the odds
for Mommy.

319
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,411
Where the hell is Wilson?
He's the oncologist.

320
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:30,819
Good plan. Cure cancer.

321
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:33,119
I'm surprised no one ever
thought of that before.

322
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:36,520
There he is.

323
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:39,029
Dr. House.

324
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:42,692
You guys bust out?
We made bail. They won't let us
in our baby's room.

325
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:46,829
Weird. You think they'd let you
take her home while they figured out
if you tried to kill her.

326
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:49,271
We're good parents.
We fed her whenever she was hungry.

327
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:51,571
Big meals. We had no idea
that diet was so bad.

328
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,907
The nutritionist said
it had everything she needed.
Listen.

329
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:58,473
The kid who stacks the free-range
grapefruit in your health food store
is not a nutritionist.

330
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,484
But my uncle is.

331
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:02,986
He went to college and everything.

332
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:14,994
- Foreman, I need a C.T. scan on--
- Olive Kaplan.

333
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:16,762
Seriously?

334
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,272
Olive Kaplan.

335
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,707
Look for abscesses
or occult infections. Yeah.

336
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:26,801
Bye-bye.

337
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,782
Listen. Vogler's all about
clinical trials.

338
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,824
The hospital's chock full of them.

339
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:42,359
There's gotta be something
for small-cell lung cancer.

340
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:45,162
What are you doing?

341
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,528
I got sacked.

342
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:51,126
Did you make a pass at Cuddy?

343
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,671
I told you.
She only has thighs for me.

344
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:55,639
I voted to keep you.

345
00:22:56,408 --> 00:23:00,071
So he's getting rid of
every board member
who votes to keep me around.

346
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:02,670
Yeah. Every one of us.

347
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:05,376
Just you?
Yep.

348
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,750
But you're only off the board, right?

349
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:12,153
They couldn't have gotten
unanimous approval for you.

350
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:15,523
Brown from oncology voted no.
So did Cuddy,

351
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:18,529
Taylor and Peavey.

352
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:21,464
Oh, so you're off the board.
Big deal.

353
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:23,592
Frees up Wednesday nights for bowling.

354
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:26,398
You're still a doctor.
Getting dumped
looks great in Who's Who.

355
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:28,564
Vogler gave me
the option of resigning.

356
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,898
And I took it.

357
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:33,877
Big of him.
I got no kids.

358
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:36,709
My marriages sucks.
I only had two things
that worked for me.

359
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:38,875
This job and this stupid
screwed-up friendship,

360
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,384
and neither mattered enough to you
to give one lousy speech.

361
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,251
They matter.

362
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:57,231
If I could do it all again--
You'd do the same thing.

363
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:08,579
Well, you'll be gone soon too.

364
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:18,649
Those clinical trials?

365
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,122
I'll make some calls.

366
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:33,800
Thanks.

367
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:44,644
It's-- It's not cancer.
It's not gonna kill me?

368
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:48,982
- It's hemorrhoids.
- But all that blood--
I mean, that can't be right.

369
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:51,318
Looks worse than it is.

370
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:55,083
- Nice job of protecting me.
- Can this wait?

371
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,754
His ass can wait.
You save my job
by sacking Wilson?

372
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,320
What did you think would happen
when you made that speech?

373
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:03,834
That you would just pout
for a little while
and we'd all forgive you?

374
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:06,666
You don't spit on the man
that signs your paycheck.

375
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:09,298
First Cameron, then Wilson.

376
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:11,103
You're next.
Pull your pants up.

377
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,770
So it's about the money.
Ofcourse it's about the money.

378
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:18,942
The money Vogler gave,
he could have bought a few jets,
maybe a baseball team.

379
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:22,145
Orjust stuck it in Chase Manhattan
and collected interest.

380
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:26,680
But he gave it to us
to buy equipment, to do research.

381
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:31,218
You are a great doctor, House,
but you are not worth
a hundred million dollars.

382
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,695
We've sequenced the D.N.A.
of the tumor cells.

383
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:41,637
P53 gene mutation at codon 55.
She's perfect for your trial.

384
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:44,174
Hmm. She's pretty far advanced.

385
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:48,542
Well, you want easy cases,
you picked the wrong specialty.

386
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:54,483
Otherwise in good health?
Excellent.

387
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:58,011
When can she start?
Middle of next week.

388
00:25:58,089 --> 00:26:01,889
Cancer's already stage III.
It'd be a waste of time.
She can start in two days.

389
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,554
She can't start in two days.
She's pregnant.

390
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:07,154
She won't be in two days.

391
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,326
- I've scheduled a C-section.
- She'd still have to wait a month.

392
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:13,701
You can't take part in any trial
for at least 30 days
after major surgery.

393
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:17,173
Well, it's definitely surgery, but major?

394
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:21,576
It's not your call.
Again, question
of interpretation.

395
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:23,671
You're scamming a doctor? Now?

396
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:26,216
Come on. Vogler's looking for
any excuse to can you.

397
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:28,718
Oh, I think he's got
a big bag of those already.

398
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:32,518
These regulations aren't just
here to annoy you. Doing this
is dangerous to the patient.

399
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,492
Well, I'll be sure
and let her know that.

400
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,551
Care to join me?

401
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:45,232
Angiogenesis inhibitors
prevent the tumors
from creating blood vessels.

402
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:47,271
Without blood, the tumor starves.

403
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:49,432
That sounds great.
What about the baby?

404
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:53,238
The treatment would be fatal
to the baby.

405
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:56,974
I've scheduled a C-section
for this afternoon.
No.

406
00:26:57,048 --> 00:27:00,074
It's in the trial phase right now,
but so far...

407
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:03,245
complete remission in
more than 30% of subjects.

408
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:08,088
- I told Dr. Foreman I didn't want a C-section.
- When your chances of living were less
than a third of what they are now.

409
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,952
Well, if the baby's
premature, then--

410
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:15,397
Our Pediatrics department has
the best neonatal I.C.U. in the state.

411
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:18,436
No. His lungs. His brain.
He's not ready.

412
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:21,666
And he could be fine.
You don't know what it's like
raising a sick child.

413
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:25,733
His odds are much better
than yours are.

414
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:29,177
You have to let them at least try this.

415
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:31,579
- Talk to her.
- Okay.

416
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:34,575
Leave the room.

417
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:37,621
Okay.

418
00:27:46,898 --> 00:27:49,890
How long have you
been taking oxybutynin?

419
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:51,959
Uh, since I was about 20.

420
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:56,535
Incontinence is pretty uncommon
in a woman of your age.

421
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:59,133
It's even more bizarre
in a woman in her 20s.

422
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:02,145
I guess I haven't had the best luck
when it comes to my health.

423
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:05,806
Seems that way.

424
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:10,446
You said to your husband,
"You don't know what it's like
raising a sick child".

425
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:13,320
You didn't say, "You don't know
what it would be like".

426
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:18,486
This is not your first child, is it?

427
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:22,656
And he doesn't know.

428
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:29,063
I was 18.

429
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:32,234
I got pregnant, got married.

430
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:36,838
I had the most beautiful
little girl. Grace.

431
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:41,711
She had infantile Alexander's disease.

432
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:47,091
I'm sorry.
Two years
we watched her die.

433
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:50,491
My husband was a--
Uh, my first husband was a--

434
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:54,559
a great guy,

435
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:58,534
but after that I couldn't even
look at him without thinking of her.

436
00:28:58,603 --> 00:29:01,333
I left him.

437
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:04,671
I left my job.
I left everything.
Very moving story.

438
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:08,042
Explains why you're being so selfish.

439
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:10,206
I'm willing to die
to protect my husband.

440
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:13,773
Because it's what you want.
Your husband wants you to live.

441
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:17,845
Well, he doesn't understand--
Oh, who the hell does?

442
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,890
Tragedies happen.

443
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:23,223
If you think that turning
yourself into a disposable
incubator for a few weeks...

444
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:26,559
is gonna protect your baby
from all the crap in this world,
go ahead.

445
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:29,794
Die happy.
I got no problem
with people killing themselves.

446
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:31,859
But don't think it makes you a hero.

447
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:46,306
Okay.

448
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:52,221
You're scheduled for 4:00 p.m.

449
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,289
Yes. This is Dr. Lim.

450
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:10,838
Count down from 10.

451
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:13,503
Okay.

452
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:15,603
Ten,

453
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,012
nine,

454
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:20,073
eight--

455
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:24,611
Tray setup.
That seemed kind of fast.
Is she all right?

456
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:26,589
She's fine.

457
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:33,322
Wake her up.
That was Vogler. Surgery is off.

458
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:46,336
Hey! You're killing her!

459
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:50,871
Really? I thought you were the one
trying to ram her into a drug trial
five minutes after surgery.

460
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:52,974
She knows the risk.
She was fully informed.

461
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:56,179
Well, the guy running
the study sure wasn't.
Not his life. Not his call.

462
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:59,280
- His study, his call.
- Right. So she kicks off,
his numbers look bad.

463
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,655
The numbers look bad,
the study looks bad.

464
00:31:01,726 --> 00:31:04,820
Which would cost you money!
And keep a lifesaving
protocol off the market.

465
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:07,626
One person! One blip in the data!

466
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,031
Ever heard of the F.D.A.?
They eat blips for breakfast.

467
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:12,069
One person should never
endanger thousands.

468
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:15,435
Well, thank God you were here
to save all those lives!

469
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:24,538
The board's meeting again
this evening.

470
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:27,710
Why don't you settle down,
play some Game Boy?

471
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:29,946
Why don't you watch your soap?

472
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:34,219
I hear they're firing
the handsome doctor today.
Boy, that should be a good one.

473
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:48,798
If we had the C-section anyway,

474
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:51,899
she could still do
the experimental treatment, right?

475
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:56,606
- We'd just have to wait 30 days.
- Assuming the doctor running the trial
isn't too pissed off to let her in.

476
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:59,844
And assuming I'm even
healthy enough to--

477
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,943
Honey.

478
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:05,581
- Are you okay?
- Sats are dropping--
down to the 80s. Stay with us, Naomi.

479
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:08,421
What's going on?
We need you to leave the room.

480
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:11,728
Respiratory distress.

481
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:14,390
- Could you tell me
what's going on?
- We're trying to find out.

482
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:20,362
Here.
Still kicking.

483
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,463
Flash pulmonary edema?

484
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:25,100
Lungs are clear.
Here it is.

485
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:27,269
- Pulmonary embolus.
- Gotta get her to an O.R.

486
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:29,870
Now. Right away.
Uh, what happened?

487
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:33,111
It's an embolism-- a blood clot.
Fairly common with lung cancer.

488
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:37,644
It's not a full saddle embolism. So blood's
still trickling through. We've been able
to get Naomi breathing a little,

489
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:41,351
but we need to remove the clot,
and we need you to approve the treatment.
Ofcourse.

490
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:44,395
Whatever you have to do, just do it.
It's not that simple.

491
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:47,898
The best course for the baby
would be an immediate C-section.
The longer we postpone,

492
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:51,732
the greater chance he'll have
brain damage from lack of oxygen.
Fine. Just do it.

493
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,771
Here's the problem.

494
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:58,434
The C-section would be
very, very dangerous for Naomi.
Dangerous like--

495
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:03,343
In her current condition,
there's a real chance she won't survive.

496
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,917
I'm sorry.

497
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:10,182
Your wife's unconscious.
We need you to make a decision.

498
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:18,053
I just want her to live.

499
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:20,120
No C-section.

500
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:35,740
Sats are still way down.
We gotta push the streptokinase.

501
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:38,407
Too risky. Even if it dissolves the clot,
she could still bleed out--

502
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:41,577
- She's hemodynamically compromised.
- It's not good for the baby.

503
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:43,142
Dad doesn't care.

504
00:33:46,924 --> 00:33:49,586
Bolusing 250,000 units.

505
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:52,458
B.P.'s dropping.

506
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,896
Pressors.
Don't have time.
We've gotta suck it out.

507
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,733
Systolic B.P.'s 80.

508
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,865
B.P.'s stabilizing.

509
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:08,275
O2 sats rising.

510
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:13,410
- Did you get the clot?
- I think so.

511
00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:17,113
She's stabilized.
How long was her oxygen at that level?

512
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:20,453
- About 10 minutes.
- Brain function compromised?

513
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:23,085
Shouldn't be, but we'll--

514
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:26,494
B.P.'s dropping.
Up the dopamine.

515
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,794
- She's not responding. How much?
- Up to 30 micrograms.

516
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:31,801
Is she septic?

517
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:34,633
She's bleeding into her abdomen.

518
00:34:34,705 --> 00:34:36,696
We won't be able to stop it.

519
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:41,503
I'll go talk to the husband.

520
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:46,346
No. You stay here.
Keep her as stable as you can
for as long as you can.

521
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:58,492
She had trauma
during the procedure.

522
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:02,331
She's bleeding into her abdomen.

523
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:05,335
There's nothing we can do.
I'm sorry.

524
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:08,668
Oh. No.

525
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:11,799
I need you to okay the C-section.
That's gonna kill her, right?

526
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:14,310
Probably will.

527
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:17,313
I can't do that.

528
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:19,542
She's dying either way.

529
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:23,314
- I'm-- I'm sorry.
- Stay with me, Sean.
I need your okay on this.

530
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:27,724
She makes the decisions, and I'm--

531
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,852
Right. And that's gonna be
tough from now on,
but this decision is easy.

532
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:34,823
You know what she'd want.
Yeah.

533
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:39,666
I can't do--
You make this call,
only two things change.

534
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:44,538
One, yeah, you feel guilty
for killing your wife.
Two, your baby lives.

535
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,942
Naomi's baby lives.

536
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:56,887
Okay. Okay.

537
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:09,259
He's out.
Umbilical cord's clamped.

538
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:12,791
No respiration.
- His lungs aren't opening up.

539
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,804
They aren't mature.

540
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:17,898
Come on. Take a breath.
You know you can do it.

541
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:21,308
What you got?

542
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:23,540
Looks like V-fib.
Pulse?

543
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:26,640
- No. Paddles.
Right here.

544
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:29,481
Come on. Come on.

545
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,785
Clear!

546
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,916
- Nothing.
- Charging.

547
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:37,051
- Good boy. Open up.
- How's he doin'?

548
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:39,929
Still not breathing.
We've gotta intubate.

549
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:42,227
Clear!

550
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:21,263
Thank you.

551
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:23,534
I'm late for the board meeting.
We need to talk.

552
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:25,667
I don't want to hear it.
It's about a patient.

553
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:29,270
The pregnant woman?
She wasn't qualified for that trial.
And I'm not gonna apologize--

554
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:34,114
I'm not talking about her. At this point,
I think it's best if I concentrate
on patients who are still alive.

555
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:39,887
Pulmonary embolism.
She bled out. Saved her son.

556
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:46,356
This is Olive Kaplan's C.T. scan--
the incredible shrinking baby.

557
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:52,859
Her thymus gland.

558
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:56,896
DiGeorge syndrome.
It's genetic. Caused the gland
to wither to nothing.

559
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:59,568
This is why she couldn't gain weight.
Yeah.

560
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:04,579
I'll call the police and Social Services
and have all the charges withdrawn.

561
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:09,143
I've sent a test down to confirm.
When it comes back, you should start Olive
on immunoglobulin replacement.

562
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,745
You're not gonna do it?

563
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:15,521
Well, I assume I won't be here.

564
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:40,548
Your boy is doing good.

565
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:05,432
It's the same motion
as yesterday, people. Same reasons.

566
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:09,946
All those in favor of dismissing
Gregory House, raise a hand.

567
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,587
Dr. Cuddy,

568
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:22,251
you realize
this is going to happen.

569
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:28,988
- I can't do it.
- You can't abstain.

570
00:39:31,168 --> 00:39:33,136
I'm not abstaining.
I'm voting no.

571
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:36,873
You've changed your mind
since yesterday?

572
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:40,399
What did he do?
Buy you dinner and roses?
Threaten to drown your dog?

573
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:42,810
- He did his job.
- Right.

574
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,814
He saved another life.

575
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,577
Maybe.
Good for him.

576
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:49,016
- It's great. It's not the point.
- It's what we do.

577
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:52,749
And you could do it
a lot better if you didn't
have to worry about some madman...

578
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:54,848
running around the hospital
accountable to no one.

579
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:57,826
- But that's not the choice
you're giving us.
- House won't listen to anyone.

580
00:39:57,895 --> 00:40:01,956
And you're not accountable
to anybody either.
Because you think you own us.

581
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:05,365
I move for the immediate dismissal
of Dr. Lisa Cuddy.

582
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:07,267
She's upset. We all are.

583
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:09,670
Why would you risk
your career to save him?

584
00:40:14,011 --> 00:40:17,606
If you think House deserves to go--
If you think I deserve to go,

585
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:21,378
Wilson deserved to go,
then vote yes.

586
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:26,321
But if you're doing this because
you are afraid of losing
his money, then he's right.

587
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,381
He does own you.

588
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:39,535
You have a choice.
Maybe the last real one
you'll have here.

589
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:55,408
Cuddy is a genius.

590
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:59,354
Convincing four people to give up
a fortune to save our sorry asses.

591
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:03,821
Dr. Cuddy, the man of the hour.
- Hey, hey!

592
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:06,692
Hey.
What are you doing?

593
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:09,927
We're drinking. I would have
thought that was pretty obvious.

594
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,434
To the great champion.
Saved you,

595
00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:14,698
saved Wilson--
saved the whole team.

596
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:31,016
Ofcourse none of them would have
needed saving if you could actually
get along with another human being.

597
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:34,080
Thank you, Miss Buzz Kill.

598
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:36,922
Well, you only cost us
a hundred million dollars.

599
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:39,087
Could have saved some lives,

600
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:42,223
could have made a few jobs,
helped a few people-- yippee.

601
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:44,426
You voted to get rid of him.

602
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,493
The lesser of two evils.

603
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:51,134
You should be mourning.

604
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:53,199
I know I am.
