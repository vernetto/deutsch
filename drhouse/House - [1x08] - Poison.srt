1
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:04,254
You. Give me that.

2
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,060
What are you talking about?

3
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:09,499
- Mrs. Miller?
- Shh. Your phone, young lady.

4
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,629
- I was just switching it to silent
in case someone called.
- No, you were cheating.

5
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:14,969
- Please. Like I have to cheat--
- Lady?

6
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:17,339
I said wait!

7
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,379
Give it here.
Sure.

8
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:27,479
Love the blouse.

9
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:35,053
- I-I need to use the bunk room.
- The bathroom? Sure.

10
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:37,926
- In 19 minutes.
- Can't do it.

11
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:40,625
You got a friend in the bathroom
with the answers?

12
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:48,430
Fine. I'll get you an escort.

13
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,474
Don't stink up till I kill you.

14
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:01,548
Don't stand up.

15
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:05,614
D.X.D.T.

16
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:07,819
Hey, he's really sick.

17
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,129
- Eyes on your work.
- Are you all right?

18
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,899
- What is going on?
- Get some help.

19
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:57,067
The kid was just taking
his A.P. calculus exam,

20
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:59,270
when all of a sudden
he got nauseous and disoriented.

21
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,711
That's the way calculus presents.

22
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:04,807
Severe bradycardia. Heart rate's
down to 48 and falling fast.

23
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:07,318
You know the kid?
No, he just came in.

24
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:11,483
Mom real good looking?
I... didn't notice.

25
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:13,992
Then it's a mystery.

26
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,392
Not why he's sick,
but why you care so much.

27
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:19,397
Gift shop's open. Buy him a card.
He's not responding to atropine.

28
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:23,401
Boys love fart jokes.
Find one with a good fart joke.

29
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:27,371
He's a teenager. It's drugs.

30
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,377
Tell those E.R. geniuses to give him charcoal
and naloxone. Stop following me.

31
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:36,142
His tox screen was negative.
He's still whacked out.

32
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:40,676
You don't care about the kid.
You just find his illness intriguing.

33
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:43,881
His CAT scan was clean.
There's no sign of infection.
It's not diabetes.

34
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:46,255
And you don't care about him.

35
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:49,090
If that's what you wanna hear,
not in the slightest.

36
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:53,724
Me neither.
May as well be objective.

37
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,600
Maybe it's shigellosis.

38
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:03,335
Wouldn't account
for the bradycardia.

39
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,343
Viral myocarditis?

40
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,345
Wouldn't account for the whacked out.

41
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:10,780
- So, what's the differential
for a negative tox screen?
- He was clean.

42
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,978
- Unless someone screwed up the test.
- That never happens.

43
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:18,513
Or he O.D.'d on something
we didn't test for. 1.4-Butanediol
would give you these symptoms.

44
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:22,527
- That's a new one.
- Copy machine toner.

45
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:27,692
Same punch as G.H.B.
A little pricier. Way more dangerous.

46
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:32,101
On the other hand, it is legal.
I want you to go to his house
and find his stash.

47
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:34,537
I'll bet you know
all the good hiding spots.

48
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,541
Actually, I never did drugs.

49
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,578
Better go with him.
In case he gets high.

50
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:44,813
- How much atropine is the kid getting?
- One m.l.

51
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:47,580
Make it two. In case he needs
his heart later on.

52
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:52,456
Matt, did you take
any drugs this morning?

53
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:55,119
Pencils down.

54
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:58,459
Can you squeeze
my fingers for me?

55
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:05,126
Did anyone give you anything
to help with the math test?

56
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:10,104
- Matt?
- I told you. He doesn't take drugs.

57
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:14,078
Ms. Davis, all parents
think that about their children,

58
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,342
and they're usually wrong.

59
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:19,408
I gave my mum a little trouble
when I was his age.

60
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,749
I turned out okay.
Even she thought so.

61
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:25,814
I know my kid.
The fact that you did drugs
doesn't mean he did.

62
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,152
Did he go anywhere last night?

63
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,832
No, he was home studying.

64
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:37,768
- Any friends come over to help him?
- And bring him drugs?

65
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,032
Is that what your friends did?
Ms. Davis.

66
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:44,805
Look, I tested him myself.

67
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:47,437
The home kit.
I took some hair off his brush.

68
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,949
I didn't want him to know about it,
because I do trust him.

69
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,951
Then why did you test him?

70
00:05:55,788 --> 00:06:00,521
All he did last night was study
and argue about his college interviews.

71
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:04,893
He wants to be himself--
no haircut, ratty old clothes.

72
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:06,898
That'll go over big.

73
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:09,491
Then we both gave up
and went to bed. That's it.

74
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:13,903
Has he ever had any problems
like this before? Any family history?

75
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:17,170
No, it's just me and Matt.

76
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:19,234
Diazepam. Ten milligrams, stat.
Right.

77
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:22,645
- What's going on?
-Just taking some precautions.

78
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:27,414
He's seizing.
Help me hold him.

79
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:31,423
Stay cool, mate.
We'll calm you down.

80
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,229
This room is way too clean
for a teenage boy.

81
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:47,568
- You know why House thinks I'm a druggie?
- This is gonna be a racial thing, isn't it?

82
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:52,703
Same reason he thinks this kid overdosed.
When you're a drug addict,
you wanna believe everyone else is too.

83
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:55,873
He's not addicted.
He has to take drugs.

84
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:58,382
The definition of an addict.

85
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:01,352
He's in pain.
And addicted to pain killers.

86
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,049
What a coincidence!

87
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:08,420
You really never did any drugs?

88
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:10,689
Now this is gonna be a racial thing.

89
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:15,393
Deflecting a personal question with a joke.
Gee, who do I know that does that?

90
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:20,462
Yeah, I'm just like him.
Except for the angry, bitter,
pompous cripple part.

91
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,168
Maybe we should all pitch in
and get you a nice cane.

92
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:26,109
You already have
the matching gym shoes.

93
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,718
Check this out!

94
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,657
Mom's not too careful
with the homemade tomato sauce.

95
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:46,398
When the top sticks out like that,
it's a sign of bacterial contamination.

96
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,240
This one's open.

97
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:06,616
I am extremely disappointed in you.

98
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:11,690
I send you out for exciting
new designer drugs,

99
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:14,555
and you come back
with tomato sauce.

100
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:18,188
I bet you paid twice as much.
I got mine online.

101
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:22,530
Matt decided to make himself
a homemade pizza for a bedtime snack.

102
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:25,036
Source of botulism,
as well as a million other toxins...

103
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:27,902
that cause gastroenteritis,
cardiac symptoms and mental confusion.

104
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:32,274
I'm not so sure about gastroenteritis.
But mental confusion? Bring it on.

105
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:36,645
- Don't -- But--
- Mmm. Delicious.

106
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:39,514
- Do you have a death wish?
- I notice you didn't try to save me.

107
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:42,679
I figured you were trying to make
some kind of subtle point.

108
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:46,486
I was. The kid just started seizing.
Not a symptom of food-borne toxins.

109
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:50,051
Also not a symptom of drug use.
Not two hours after admission.

110
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:54,896
So what would make him seize,
in addition to all these other
delightful symptoms?

111
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:57,663
- Pesticide poisoning.
- Carbamates.

112
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:00,331
Or organophosphates,
organochlorines.

113
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:04,001
- Inhalation or absorption?
- Too soon to tell.

114
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:06,670
We should wash him down.
The poison could still be on his skin.

115
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:09,715
Already told the nurses.

116
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:25,892
Nursing supervisor to the instrument room.

117
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:29,731
- I feel good.
- That's your complaint?

118
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,365
Your major symptom.
I told her this was a waste of time.

119
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,340
I notice colors more.

120
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:40,937
And music! I--
I'm really hearing music.

121
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:46,781
I'm 82, and I'm supposed to be playing
canasta with the other old ladies,

122
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:52,017
but now... when I see a guy
with a cute butt,

123
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:55,390
I can't stop looking at him.

124
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:59,227
Or... a sexy beard.

125
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:04,634
And you figure that enjoying
cute butts is a sign of disease?

126
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:09,073
It all started a month ago when Mark
rented Gone With the Wind for me,

127
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:11,803
but it had the wrong DVD in it.

128
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:13,742
Oh! Oh, right. I-I forgot.
This is all my fault.

129
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:17,305
Ofcourse, he was
too busy to bring it back.
Yeah, like I don't have a life.

130
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:21,217
So I watched it,
and it had this actor in it--

131
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,222
this kid called Ashton Kutcher.

132
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,488
Now... I think about Ashton...

133
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:31,553
all the time.

134
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:35,192
All... the time.

135
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:39,601
- Ah.
- You remind me of him.

136
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:42,334
Same bedroom eyes.

137
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,842
People are always mixing us up.

138
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:48,107
I-I-I suppose you--
you need to check my heart?

139
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:52,241
- No! No, no, that--
that won't be necessary.
- I told you.

140
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,684
But I am going to admit you
to the hospital for tests.

141
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:58,690
What tests? She's just old.
And you're just insufferable.

142
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:01,818
Your mother has had a sudden personality
change. It should be checked out.

143
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:05,830
I'll have a nurse come in and admit her.
I'm too handsome to do paperwork.

144
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,670
Anesthesiologist to O.R. Room 4.

145
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,641
Anesthesiologist to O.R. Room 4.

146
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:24,143
He's been on this medication
for over an hour.

147
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:28,448
Pralidoxime is very effective.
It just takes a little time for it to kick in.

148
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,490
And maybe you're wrong.
Maybe it's not a pesticide.

149
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:35,015
The blood work was pretty conclusive.
It's an organophosphate.

150
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:40,956
Oh, my God.

151
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:44,161
Move back.
Ms. Davis, move back, please.

152
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:48,496
We're at 30. Bradycarciac arrest.
Get me the pads.

153
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:51,509
What are you doing?

154
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:56,344
We're gonna beat his heart for him.
Set it at 60.

155
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,141
I can't stand this anymore.

156
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:34,152
We'll keep him on the pads
for another hour.
Then what?

157
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:37,321
Let's see what happens.

158
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:42,122
Well, that's not my philosophy.

159
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:44,492
Especially when it comes to my son.

160
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:49,899
And if something bad might happen,
I'd like to know what our options are.

161
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:55,063
The pralidoxime isn't doing him any good.
We're gonna have to wire his heart.

162
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:57,871
- Maybe we're wrong about the pesticides.
- I ran his plasma again, twice.

163
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,343
Are there any stronger treatments
for the organophosphate poisoning?

164
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:05,213
Oh, damn it! You caught me.
We went with the weak stuff.
I was just trying to save a little money.

165
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:08,583
Actually, one of my professors
at Columbia developed an experimental
treatment for the army.

166
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:12,112
- What's the success rate?
- They're targeted. There's a different
hydrolase treatment for each poison.

167
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,887
We'd need to know if Matt got hit
with Orthene or malathion--

168
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,225
- What's the success rate?
- Excellent, I'm sure. It's the U.S. Army.

169
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:22,199
"Be all you can be". Point is,
what are the kid's chances without it?

170
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:25,203
Minimal at best. The poison's
broken the blood-brain barrier.

171
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:29,503
I assume "minimal at best"
is your stiff-upper-lip British way
of saying "no chance in hell".

172
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:34,035
- I'm Australian.
- You put the queen on your money.
You're British. Call your professor.

173
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:36,911
If we don't know what kind
of organophosphate we're targeting,

174
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,348
we don't know
which hydrolase to ask for.

175
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:42,910
- There's over 40 organophosphates.
- I'll get all of 'em.
- Get all of 'em.

176
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:47,220
- Great minds think alike.
- By the time they get here, we're
gonna know which one we need.

177
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:50,729
If we figure out how he got exposed,
we'll figure out what he was exposed to.

178
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:52,730
Well, the mom had
homemade tomato sauce.

179
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:55,289
Call me crazy, but I'm thinking
maybe... homemade tomatoes?

180
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,528
Front yard. Vegetable garden.

181
00:13:57,603 --> 00:14:00,037
Kid's out there spraying,
sees a pretty girl,

182
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:03,199
hormones raging,
spray can goes off in his face.

183
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:06,802
- I'll check into it.
- I'll make the call.

184
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,871
I'll keep the kid alive.
For a while, at least.

185
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,278
I'll have lunch.

186
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,650
Through the superior vena cava...

187
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:19,086
into the right atrium...

188
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:21,888
through the tricuspid valve...

189
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:27,462
and lodging to the wall
of the right ventricle.

190
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,569
Can you turn off the pad?

191
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:40,775
- Capturing?
- Getting a native heart rate of 36.

192
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:42,905
No, that won't do.
Let's get him to 50.

193
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:10,773
"The healer with his magic powers!

194
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:15,371
I could rub his gentle brow for hours.

195
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:20,214
His manly chest, his stubbled jaw.

196
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:22,846
Everything about him leaves me raw"--

197
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,255
- Psych ward's upstairs.
- "with joy.

198
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:32,195
Oh, House, your very name
will never leave this girl the same".

199
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:36,257
It's not bad for an 82-year-old.
She asked me to give that
to her true love.

200
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:39,202
What can I say?
Chicks with no teeth turn me on.

201
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:42,263
That's fairly disgusting.
And that's ageism.

202
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:44,809
You better watch yourself
around this babe.

203
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:47,368
Here are her test results.

204
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,984
Impressive.

205
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:58,489
Yeah.

206
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:00,718
I found the pesticide.
It's disulfoton.

207
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:04,024
And it's empty.
He used up the whole can.
Okay, I'll get Chase on it.

208
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:09,159
The poison's called disulfoton.
This should bond with it
and neutralize the poison.

209
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:12,897
Then his nervous system
will start sending the correct
signals to the rest of his body.

210
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:16,373
But there was no disul--
well, that stuff in that can.

211
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:18,672
The label says "disulfoton".
I can show you.

212
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:20,712
But you didn't test it.

213
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:23,577
You said Matt sprayed with it
this morning before school.

214
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,413
Matt started that garden himself
for an environmental science class.

215
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:29,010
- They weren't allowed to use pesticides.
- Apparently he cheated a little.

216
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:33,787
It was orange peel oil. Totally organic.
He dumped that other stuff last winter.

217
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:37,226
The symptoms fit. There must
have been some left in the can.

218
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:40,197
If you're wrong, what will
this treatment do to him?

219
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:44,395
Well, theoretically, it could
increase the toxicity and--

220
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,563
But we're not wrong.
Don't.

221
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:50,096
We're not wrong.
I can't let you do this.

222
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:58,711
Get a court order.
Unless you wanna see someone
killed by sheer irrationality.

223
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:02,311
Maternal instinct is always irrational.
Doesn't mean it's wrong.

224
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,754
Actually, that's the definition.

225
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:06,882
It doesn't make her
mentally incompetent.

226
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,893
She's risking her son's life...

227
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:11,794
based on a teenager's claim
that he washed something.

228
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,957
How mentally incompetent
can you get?

229
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,365
That's a brilliant legal argument.

230
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:23,066
Listen, have your Harvard law dog
whip up some high-grade
legal-sounding psychobabble:

231
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:26,305
"Temporary insanity brought on
by acute panic distress syndrome."

232
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,642
I don't care. We have to give him
the hydrolase.

233
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:32,047
Her only sign of mental illness
is that she disagrees with you.

234
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:34,608
Some would consider that
a sign of sanity.

235
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:38,918
Not the kid. Let's ask him.
Oh, no, I forgot. We can't. He's dying.

236
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:44,293
Get the mother to sign off
that she's refusing this treatment.

237
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:57,032
Good-bye.

238
00:17:57,109 --> 00:18:01,045
"I, Margo Davis,
have been informed of the risks...

239
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:03,707
which may arise from my refusal
of advised medical care.

240
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:06,376
- I hereby release"--
- Who are you?

241
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,613
I work for the hospital.

242
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:11,679
"...the Princeton Plainsboro
Teaching Hospital and its employees,

243
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:15,955
agents and otherwise, for any adverse
medical conditions resulting from my refusal.

244
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:19,054
It is not the hospital's fault
if my son kicks off".

245
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:24,626
- Kicks off?
- I punched up the language.
Mostly for clarification.

246
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:28,537
"I understand my doctors consider
my decision to be completely idiotic"--

247
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:32,043
Why are you doing this?
- "But I am convinced
I know more than they do.

248
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,671
I took a biology course in high school".

249
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:37,010
I assume that's-- Yeah.

250
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:41,815
"Besides, I enjoy controlling
every single aspect of my son's life,

251
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:44,720
even if it means his death".

252
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:49,121
Sign here, please.
I brought a pen.

253
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:54,658
Who are you?
I'm the doctor
who's trying to save your son.

254
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:57,497
You're the mom who's letting him die.

255
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:00,197
Clarification-- It's a beautiful thing.

256
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:11,075
Dr. Morell, contact the CAPlab.
Dr. Morell, contact the CAPlab.

257
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:15,519
She rethought her position.
Start him on the hydrolase.

258
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:18,021
No. We've got a problem.

259
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,691
Three. One, two, three.

260
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:26,160
Heart rate's 49.
O2 stat, 84 and falling.

261
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:28,631
Saline, atropine and diazepam, now.

262
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,760
His name is Chi Ling.
He was admitted 12 minutes ago.

263
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:35,034
Identical symptoms as Matt.
Chase isn't sure he's gonna make it.

264
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,210
This one. Bag.

265
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:06,436
Matt's next-door neighbor,
by any chance?

266
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:08,871
They live 10 miles apart.

267
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:11,375
Apparently, they
don't even know each other.

268
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:36,968
We live in an apartment.
We have two bamboo trees.

269
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:40,664
No pesticides.
Just dry seaweed for fertilizer.

270
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:45,073
The second kid's heart
is almost as weak as Matt's.
We may need to get it wired up too.

271
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:49,079
And I don't know how long
Matt's brain will hold up. His heart's
not pumping enough oxygen.

272
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:51,081
How much are you giving him?
80%.

273
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:53,344
Make it 90.
We're risking damage
to his retina.

274
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:56,046
What the heck. Do it anyway.
He's a calculus student.

275
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:59,579
Probably likes having a brain.
I'll have Foreman take care of it.

276
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:03,253
- I'm the primary.
- Yeah, but the mom
wants to get rid of you.

277
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:05,523
And you know me.
I'm a people-pleasing kind of guy.

278
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:09,089
She complained? About me?
She went to the principal.

279
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:13,604
Told Cuddy you took drugs in high school.
This is gonna go on your permanent record.

280
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:16,800
I was trying to get information.
It was a strategy.

281
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,900
She also used the word "slacker".
You wanna come in?

282
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:22,708
Smoke a little weed?
Watch some MTV?

283
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:26,616
High school has no idea
what could have happened.

284
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:29,654
You sure that Chi didn't sneak
onto Matt's tomato patch?

285
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:31,916
Maybe they sniffed disulfoton
together to get high.

286
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,220
Same school, different grades,
different cliques, different everything.

287
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,955
They managed to get poisoned together.
They must have something in common.

288
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:41,557
Their classes aren't even
in the same building. They don't even
eat lunch in the same lunchroom.

289
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,794
How do they get to school?

290
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:50,004
Unless you're with the board,
the police or the union,
I don't care who you are.

291
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:52,009
Sir, we need to test the bus
for chemical residue.

292
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:54,238
And I need to pick up
the basketball team.

293
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,645
You got a problem with that,
call my supervisor.

294
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:59,775
Two kids were poisoned
on your bus this morning.

295
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:02,183
They're dying.

296
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:09,517
My God. The things he said.

297
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:13,189
Dr. House wanted your son
to get the medicine he needed.

298
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:17,167
- He was willing to do whatever
it took to make that happen.
- The wrong kind of medicine.

299
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:21,433
He didn't know that.
At the time, it was our only choice.

300
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,667
He would have known
if he had listened to me.

301
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:26,176
He listened.

302
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:28,940
He just assumed you were wrong.

303
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:33,683
To be honest, that's true
of most of our patients.

304
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:37,313
You're just as pompous
and superior as he is!

305
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,461
Uh, Matt is back row right.
The Asian kid, uh, first or second row left.

306
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:48,397
Okay.
Look, I got this rash
in kind of my groin region.

307
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:51,402
It's, um, not a symptom.

308
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:54,234
Neither is being obnoxious.
Looks like you're in the clear.

309
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:04,041
- So who poisoned 'em?
- We're not sure yet
if it was done on purpose.

310
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:08,246
Oh, yeah? You oughta see these little
bastards screaming and punching
each other all day long.

311
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,120
Did you happen to notice
if anyone was doing any spraying
near the bus route?

312
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:16,456
Oh! Yeah, there was this truck
down by the pond doing
something or other.

313
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:19,361
It smelled kinda funny too.

314
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:29,834
- Oh! Dr. House!
- Well, it took you long enough.
We've been waiting here--

315
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,433
Mr. Adams, would you
step outside for a moment?

316
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:35,776
Why?
Because you irritate me.

317
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:38,247
He is my son, Doctor.

318
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:40,944
He's just a little cranky
from not eating.

319
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:47,616
Fine. Mrs. Adams, have you had
any recent sexual activity?

320
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:49,626
What?

321
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:53,790
Well, I-- I don't suppose
fantasies count.

322
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:55,628
Oh, my God.

323
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:59,227
Unfortunately,
I've hit kind of a dry spell.

324
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:03,070
Only for the last--
oh, I don't know-- 15 years.

325
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:07,771
You see? She's-- She's confused.
My father died eight years ago.
Heart attack.

326
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:10,076
Not in bed, dear.

327
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:15,450
Why do you ask?

328
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,923
Because you have tested
positive for syphilis.

329
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:23,984
That's impossible!
And insulting.

330
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:29,733
I don't think it's the first time
that Mom has heard this diagnosis.

331
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:37,467
"Cupid's disease".
That's what we used to call it.

332
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:40,238
When did you get it?

333
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:45,614
Uh, 1939. Prom night, I think.

334
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:48,084
He had a Chevrolet.

335
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:51,280
It was before I met your father.

336
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:53,916
But you said that--

337
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:57,325
You said Dad was your first love.

338
00:24:57,395 --> 00:24:59,556
He was.

339
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:04,125
We're talking about sex.

340
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:07,695
But I was treated.

341
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:10,935
Which suppressed it--
in your case, for 60 years.

342
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:16,504
But now it's back, and
the spirochetes that cause syphilis
are eating away at your brain cells.

343
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:19,209
Oh! That's revolting.

344
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:22,549
It's not as revolting as chlamydia.
That's got seepage.

345
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:24,885
And it's the 21st century.

346
00:25:24,956 --> 00:25:28,448
We've got flying cars,
robot dogs and penicillin.

347
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,052
High-dose regimen
for two weeks, you're cured.

348
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:33,563
- I can't believe this.
- Yeah, well, pinch yourself.

349
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:38,626
I guess for the next two weeks,
I'd better practice safe sex.

350
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:45,401
You'll be fine.
Just feed that cranky kid.

351
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:55,719
The county's worried about West Nile,
so they sprayed ethyl-parathion
right next to the bus route.

352
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:58,415
Do you have the hydrolase
for ethyl-parathion?

353
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:01,391
Yeah. Only one problem. Matt's mother
faxed his records to the C.D.C.

354
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:05,190
She refuses to let us do anything
until she hears back from them.

355
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:08,164
Well, you're getting good
at this Godlike doctor racket.

356
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,360
Why don't you talk her
out of this lunacy?

357
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:12,562
She's not really
a big fan of mine.
Or mine.

358
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:17,574
Well, only one man left in the bull pen,
and he throws like a girl.

359
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:22,002
I hate sports metaphors.

360
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:25,343
Give her the high, hard one.

361
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:28,079
We really think
the hydrolase is the only--

362
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:30,280
I'm thinking about transferring
Matt out of here.

363
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:33,483
Ms. Davis, your son is very sick.
He won't survive a transfer.

364
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:36,686
I'm getting a second opinion
from the Center for Disease Control.

365
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:40,527
Right. Look,
when my grandmother got sick--

366
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:43,124
What? You're gonna tell me
some tough decision you had to make?

367
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:47,638
- I know how hard this is for you.
- Maybe embroider the story
a little? Make it fit?

368
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:50,197
I can't imagine being in your position.

369
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:53,904
Honesty. A kind of vulnerable honesty.
That's your thing. And the looks.

370
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:58,279
- Oh, boy.
- They send a single woman
to hustle the single mom.

371
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,784
Actually, they sent a doctor!

372
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:03,377
To tell you that if your son
doesn't get this treatment,

373
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,015
there's a good chance he'll die.

374
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:09,788
That's what House said
about a treatment
that would have killed Matt.

375
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:12,989
You've gotta
do better than that.
No, it's on you.

376
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:16,261
You need to do better.
Right now. Yes or no?

377
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:22,004
- I don't know.
- Figure it out.

378
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:25,008
Wait.

379
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:20,990
Nurse!

380
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:24,126
- Help!
- Okay. Coming.

381
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:27,899
- Seizing. Suction.
- Watch his head.

382
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:30,463
My son!

383
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:37,611
- Coming.
- Diazepam.

384
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:39,707
Got it.

385
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:43,850
- Suction.
- Ten milligrams.

386
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:46,755
- Right.
- He's not responding.
Another 10 milligrams.

387
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:48,759
You're killing him!

388
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:53,727
- You're killing him!
- Get her out of here. Get her outta here!

389
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:58,360
Come on, ma'am. Ma'am?

390
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:07,342
Their hearts are barely pumping.
Their lungs are shot.

391
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,710
Now they're showing liver toxicity.

392
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:13,114
I guess Matt's mom won't nominate us
for any Doctor of the Year awards.

393
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:16,642
Only explanation is
they got poisoned by something
besides ethyl-parathion.

394
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:19,986
Then the hydrolase
would release the neurotoxins
instead of bonding with them.

395
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:22,219
The only thing they have
in common is the bus.

396
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:24,227
Except their symptoms.
Given their severity...

397
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:28,732
and the fact their cardiac symptoms
are getting worse much faster than their
other ones, what does that tell us?

398
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,132
The poison was probably
absorbed through the skin.

399
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:34,171
They were admitted at 8:45 and 11:00.
When were they poisoned?

400
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:37,106
Absorption through the skin?
Anywhere from three to eight hours.

401
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:39,700
In a case that bad, more like
one and a half to four.

402
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:43,737
So Matt was poisoned before 7:15.
Before he got on the bus.

403
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:48,445
You're thinking each kid
got poisoned in his own house?
Two separate exposures?

404
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,785
What do teenage boys do
in the morning, besides the obvious?

405
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:54,552
Wake up, go to the bathroom,

406
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:57,720
then the obvious,
then check their zits in the mirror.

407
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:01,664
- Do they both use the same acne cream?
- Because acne cream contains lanolin,

408
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:04,964
which could have pesticides,
and you're thinking they both
bought the same product--

409
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:08,699
- It was contaminated. Shaving cream.
- Chi doesn't look like he shaves.

410
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:10,934
But he sweats.
Deodorant could contain lanolin.

411
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:14,069
Do these people have animals?
Chi has a dog. Matt has a cat.

412
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:17,239
Fleas. Flea powder.
Okay. Go to their houses.

413
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,146
Check for anything that
might have touched their skin...

414
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:21,412
between the time they got up
and the time they went to school.

415
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,784
I'm running low on tomato sauce.

416
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:29,054
Oh! Dr. House! Hello.

417
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:33,325
- I sent you home.
- Well, I came back.

418
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:36,390
I took a cab,

419
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:40,267
so my son wouldn't try
to chaperone us this time.

420
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:43,637
I'm sorry, but... the fact
that the sexual pleasure center...

421
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:46,575
of your cerebral cortex
has been overstimulated by spirochetes is--

422
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:51,672
It's a poor basis for a relationship.
I learned that one the hard way.

423
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:57,345
Doctor, um, these feelings
that I've been having--

424
00:30:57,422 --> 00:31:00,118
Is it all because of the syphilis?

425
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,453
Yes.

426
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:08,225
Then... here's the prescription
you gave me.

427
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:17,800
Well, it's not likely
I'm going to infect anyone.

428
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,709
No, but it'll kill you.

429
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:24,106
Well, gotta go sometime,

430
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:26,377
and...

431
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:31,184
I really don't want to play
canasta for the rest of my life.

432
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:35,352
I-- I like feeling sexy again...

433
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:41,023
and... making a fool out of myself
with handsome, young doctors.

434
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:47,438
Do you think that
I would have given you this...

435
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:50,303
if it would stop you
from flirting with me?

436
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:54,402
Well, but if I'm cured--
Then all the spirochetes will die off.

437
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:59,974
But the little pieces of your cerebral cortex
that have been destroyed won't grow back.

438
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:04,219
You're brain damaged.

439
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:07,224
Doomed to feeling good
for the rest of your life.

440
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:13,325
Really? Well, thank you.

441
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:15,263
Georgia.

442
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:18,268
Yeah.

443
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:21,271
When I stop being contagious,

444
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:24,274
I'll come by for a checkup.

445
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:32,013
Yeah.

446
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,118
- Matt uses Sure.
- Chi uses Old Spice.

447
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:40,623
- No zit cream.
- Lucky kid.

448
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:43,559
Floral air freshener.
Doesn't matter.

449
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:47,564
When was the last time you heard
of a teenage boy using air freshener?

450
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,566
Pert shampoo.

451
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,727
Um, Johnson's over here.

452
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,064
Matt's mom would make him
use air freshener.

453
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,801
There are limits
to a mother's power. Even hers.

454
00:32:57,875 --> 00:32:59,775
Just check.

455
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,640
Negative on the floral.

456
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:05,649
Matt's A.L.T.'s are up to 800.

457
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:08,982
If they get any higher,
we can toss his liver.

458
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:12,079
- Yeah.
- No matches on flea powder
or underarm deodorant.

459
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,784
- Or any other kind of deodorant.
- What about shampoo?

460
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:18,693
No to shampoo, bar soap,
dish soap, dish detergent.

461
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:21,755
How about laundry detergent?
Maybe they both washed
their clothes this morning.

462
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,960
I'll check.
You know, if we cure Matt,

463
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:27,198
he can use his close brush with death
on his college essays.

464
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:30,001
- Admission guys love that stuff.
- That's how you got in, right?

465
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:32,269
Jailhouse diary?

466
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:36,472
Uh, TKO.

467
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:41,143
TKO. Liquid?

468
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:43,449
Liquid, 128 ounces.

469
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:46,979
- 128. Yellow jug. "Special"--
- "Environmentally safe formula".

470
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:49,151
It's the same.
Bring in the detergent.

471
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,923
So the detergent was
contaminated with pesticides?

472
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:54,988
Which soaked into their clothes
and got absorbed into their skin.

473
00:33:56,701 --> 00:34:00,364
Hi. Uh, listen, the clothes
your son wore today--

474
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:03,271
- He washed them this morning, right?
- What?

475
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:06,777
Nice, respectful Asian kid
does the laundry.

476
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:10,177
My wife said he didn't.

477
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:15,350
Well, then I'm betting he washed them
last night without you knowing.

478
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:19,720
He doesn't even know
how to turn on the machine.

479
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:23,784
And those clothes were new.
Nobody washed them.
His clothes are all new?

480
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:26,989
The ones he wore today, yes.
Never washed.

481
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:37,073
Now what?

482
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:42,445
What about Matt's clothes?
Were they new?

483
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:45,573
Uh, they're ratty old jeans,
I think.

484
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,584
They've been bagged
and taken downstairs.

485
00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:00,297
"Davis".
Yeah, they're Matt's.

486
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:05,602
And they're old.

487
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:09,367
And yet the label
isn't faded in the slightest.

488
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,103
Fake old. Hundred dollars
for the homeless look.

489
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:16,704
What? Kids aren't
pretentious in England?

490
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:21,081
Chi was wearing a different brand.
How could they both
have been contaminated?

491
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:25,020
That is the question for the ages.
Meantime, get these tested.

492
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:57,854
I never bother to wash
new clothes before I wear them.

493
00:35:57,922 --> 00:36:02,052
Right. Your wife does. She likes you
feeling nice and comfortable.

494
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:05,289
Hey, I'm a man.
I don't have time for laundry.

495
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:07,888
I'm saving lives here.

496
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:10,456
No, she doesn't wash them either.

497
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:15,131
So your skin absorbs a little dye,
the odd chemical here and there.

498
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:17,606
You know me--
Mr. Living On The Edge.

499
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:21,133
Judging by the self-importance
of your strut, you have identified
the chemical in question.

500
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:24,340
- Phosdrin.
- Hit 'em with the hydrolase.

501
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:28,010
- Chi's parents said yes, but--
- Mighty Mom said no.

502
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:33,022
Well, she's gonna feel like a million bucks
when Chi lives and her son dies.

503
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:37,754
Send Cameron. She's the only one of you
who's managed to talk her into anything.

504
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:41,423
Not this time. Matt's mom
won't make a move until she gets
that opinion from the C.D.C.

505
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:45,929
Godot would be faster.

506
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,404
What is this?

507
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:23,906
Thought I'd hang out.

508
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:30,011
In case you change your mind.

509
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,345
Then I could give Matt
the medicine right away.

510
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:40,850
Don't worry. I've got time.

511
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,827
The C.D.C. promised they'd call.

512
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:47,830
I'm sure they will.

513
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:51,163
Maybe tomorrow.
Maybe the day after.

514
00:37:51,235 --> 00:37:54,068
It takes time
to review faxed records.

515
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:58,837
Then they'll probably tell you
they can't make a decision
based on faxed records.

516
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:03,310
This is Suzie.

517
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:06,009
She's never gonna marry him.
No money.

518
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:08,244
What makes you think
you're right this time?

519
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:12,249
Same reason as last time.

520
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:19,120
If you wanna see how the other kid
does first, that's okay.

521
00:38:19,196 --> 00:38:22,757
Might help you. Although
there's a real good chance--

522
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:28,100
- What? Matt might kick off?
- That's a little blunt.

523
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:30,299
I was gonna say "run out of time"...

524
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:34,435
or just kind of let my voice trail off.

525
00:38:43,754 --> 00:38:47,690
Hello?
Yes, this is Margo Davis.

526
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:54,792
But you have his records.
I sent them.

527
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,830
Yes, I understand.

528
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:11,637
They can't help me.
They haven't seen him.

529
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:15,015
They can't make a decision--
Give it to him.

530
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:30,456
"The C.D.C. is unable to give
an opinion at this time, ma'am.

531
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:34,026
We're gonna have a doctor
in your area next week".

532
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:36,596
You fooled her with that?

533
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:48,004
House!

534
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:32,045
So I'm gonna be cured?
As long as you don't wear
any more poison pants.

535
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:36,954
I'm sorry, Mom.
I knew the pants were stolen.

536
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:41,327
They were only five bucks.
You're gonna give me hell,
aren't you?

537
00:41:41,398 --> 00:41:44,265
Oh, honey,
I'm just glad you're alive.

538
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,633
Let's get you home
so you can rest.

539
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:49,298
Maybe I am too hard on you.

540
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:51,568
You don't have to make up
that test till next week.

541
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:55,339
You can stay in bed
and work on your applications.

542
00:41:55,412 --> 00:41:58,506
Some guy was selling pants
off the back of his truck near the school.

543
00:41:58,582 --> 00:42:01,073
When he wasn't busy
as a clothing entrepreneur,

544
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:03,585
he did day labor
at a cornfield out on Route 1.

545
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:06,054
He used the same truck
for both jobs.

546
00:42:06,123 --> 00:42:09,684
So he spilled pesticide on the pants
and was too lazy to clean up.

547
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,957
Real question is
why are you still here?

548
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:16,397
Why aren't you out there
making up with the joyful mother?

549
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:20,130
Why would I do that?
No reason at all.

550
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:23,867
If you don't care about her.
Or her son.

551
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,672
Oh, Dr. House.

552
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,775
The C.D.C. called.

553
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,718
- Again.
- Oops.

554
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:46,053
- Who are those guys?
- Oh, they're the arrogant jerks
that saved your life.
