1
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:13,940
- I gotta go.
- No, no. He'll be here.

2
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:17,745
- I'm sure he's just running a little late.
- He's canceled two exams. He's not gonna--

3
00:00:17,817 --> 00:00:19,944
He's scared of you.
Sure.

4
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,215
The ex-boy toy.
Yeah, that makes sense.

5
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:24,518
- He wasn't scared before.
- Right.

6
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:26,889
You think being afraid of me
is a symptom of a serious ailment?

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,554
Sudden mood swings,
infantile regression, abdominal pain.

8
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:32,530
He's passed out twice.
Yeah, I think it might be
a medical problem.

9
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:35,193
- He's 20 minutes late.
I'm out of here.
- Please.

10
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:38,464
He'll be here.
Why?

11
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,699
Because he loves you
and does everything he's told?

12
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:44,232
Because I didn't tell him you'd be here.

13
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:55,381
- He likes to see.
- Yes, he does.

14
00:00:56,656 --> 00:00:58,624
Stace?

15
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:01,790
- What's going on?
- Hey.

16
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:03,954
Hi. I'm Greg House.
You must be Matt.

17
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,555
- Mark.
- Mark Warner. Don't get up.

18
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,628
Sorry. Parent conferences.
Hi.
It's okay.

19
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:14,802
- Wow. Greg House.
- Yeah. Wow.

20
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:17,809
No, I haven't been avoiding you.
I just didn't want to waste your time.

21
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:21,074
The other doctors checked me out.
They said it was just stress.

22
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:24,605
- College season.
Kids, parents-- They're all over me.
- Makes sense to me.

23
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:26,982
- Greg.
- What do you want me to do?
- You said you'd check him out.

24
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:29,351
He says he's healthy.
What's to check out?

25
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:33,324
Sorry for the mix-up,
but I'm glad you two
got a chance to catch up.

26
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:36,260
- Looks like you're having fun.
- Oh, he's good.

27
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,931
If you can fake sincerity,
you can fake pretty much anything.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,834
- I can't tell you how much I like your fella.
- Yeah, me too.

29
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:46,997
You know,
I thought you'd be all sarcastic.

30
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:51,533
Bitter, you know,
because Stacy married me.

31
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:55,547
We should do things together.
Maybe throw a ball around
or something. Guy stuff.

32
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:58,175
- We could go for a run together.
- Ah! It's Oscar Wilde.

33
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:00,651
Wow. This pissing contest
is really turning me on.

34
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,847
He needs to go to the hospital.
Here's to women.

35
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:07,291
Can't live with 'em,
you can't kill 'em and tell the neighbors
they're stripping in Atlantic City.

36
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,624
Damn straight.

37
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:17,594
- I'm definitely taller.
- I have more hair.

38
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,161
And I think that-- Whoa.

39
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,209
Mark?

40
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:28,012
- Someone call 911 for a wagon
to Princeton Plainsboro?
- Garçon!

41
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:33,343
- What happened?
- It's okay, ladies and gentlemen.
Nothing to worry about.

42
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:35,717
- Unless you had the veal.
- You dosed him.

43
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:39,485
I told you I'd check him out.
I was a little worried they were gonna
get here before he passed out.

44
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:42,357
Would have been tougher
to get him to drink.

45
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:44,726
I'll give you a ride.
We can talk.

46
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:27,467
A tummy ache, cranky--
no apparent source.

47
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:31,775
Any thoughts?

48
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:35,302
Foreman, you're gonna contribute,
or are you too tired from stealing cars?

49
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:42,982
- I'm being House. It's funny.
- I know. You made milk come out of my nose.

50
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:47,049
Morning. You guys got the file.
What's wrong?

51
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:50,562
Previous tests revealed nothing
that would cause abdominal pain
or the mood swings.

52
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:54,259
Then we're done.
What do you think? Ball game? Zoo?

53
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,825
- I don't care.
I just want to hang with you guys.
- What about drugs?

54
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:00,430
His tox screen on admission showed
a massive amount of chloral hydrate.

55
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:02,838
Yeah. Sorry. That was me.

56
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,275
I had to dope him up
to get him in here.

57
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:08,143
Guy doesn't think he's sick.
Who does?

58
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:11,513
His wife.
The woman you used to live with.

59
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,644
That's her Indian name.
On her driver's license it's Stacy.

60
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,655
I assume you have a point.

61
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:19,692
You believe her over the patient himself.
That's why we're taking this case.

62
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,627
The truth?
I hear voices all the time
telling me to do stuff.

63
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:26,358
- It's crazy, huh?
- What happened to "everybody lies"?

64
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:30,661
I was lying.

65
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:33,262
Do the things-- the blah, blah, blah, blah.
All that stuff the other docs did.

66
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:35,500
If that's negative,
ultrasound his belly.

67
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:39,807
If that's negative, C.T. his abdomen
and pelvis with and without contrast.

68
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,938
- Did I miss anything?
- Kitchen sink.

69
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:45,610
Well, we could certainly give that--
Oh, you minx!

70
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:51,856
What you're thinking is,
you're going to save him,
be a hero and win her back.

71
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:54,392
It's always impressive,
that level of twisted narcissism.

72
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,657
She's married.
Big clue I lost the game.

73
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,291
You can't be within 50 feet
of Stacy Warner.

74
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:03,301
Thought she wanted me
to treat him.

75
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:05,360
Treat the husband,
stay away from the wife.

76
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:08,134
But what if they get close to each other?
What do I do then?

77
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:11,142
Hey. You have to treat this
like a regular case.

78
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,976
Be yourself--
cold, uncaring, distant.

79
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:18,176
Please, don't put me on a pedestal.

80
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:25,020
We C.T.'d your abdomen.
Nothing that would explain
the stomach pain.

81
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:27,355
- What's the next move?
- Leaving.

82
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:29,418
How many more tests do I need?

83
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,328
How many more doctors need to clear me
before we can get back to our life?

84
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:34,889
- Just one.
- House.

85
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:38,334
It must be awkward
being treated by a man who used to
be involved with your wife.

86
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:45,267
It's awkward being in a hospital
when there's nothing wrong with me.

87
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:51,041
M.R.A.'s were clean,
which means he's probably fine.

88
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:53,415
He doesn't seem paranoid.
He shows no signs of--

89
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:56,011
No. It means we have no idea
what's wrong with him.

90
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:58,785
Ben Goldstein says his schedule's locked.
He can't do it before tomorrow.

91
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,258
No. Today. Call him,
tell him I'll make it work.

92
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:03,420
You're cutting him open?

93
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:06,693
Oh, hold it. There's no need
for exploratory surgery.

94
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,631
Dr. Cameron has a diagnosis.

95
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,898
No, I just think it's premature
and maybe irresponsible...

96
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:14,235
to do exploratory surgery
before we know he's actually sick.

97
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:17,242
No, it's "premature" to put him
on a list for hospice care.

98
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:21,076
And it's "maybe irresponsible"
to imply my actions are not
rationally supported.

99
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,411
All we have is his wife--
Who says his stomach hurts.

100
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:26,714
Works for me.
The patient doesn't even think he's sick.
Why would he consent to--

101
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:29,584
His wife's a lawyer.
She's very convincing.

102
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:32,647
Call Goldstein. Surgery is on.

103
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:48,062
Retract.

104
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:51,543
Insert.

105
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:55,680
Leslie versus Leslie
seems to be right on point,

106
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,649
but I'm sure they're going to
try to distinguish it by--

107
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:02,950
Sorry. They'll try to distinguish it
relying on the minority opinion.

108
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,492
Double milk, no sugar.

109
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,460
I like sugar now.

110
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:26,778
Some people would be
annoyed by that.

111
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:33,413
You know why people
sit in waiting rooms?
This is gonna be good.

112
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:38,321
People think the closer they're
sitting to the operating room,
the more they care.

113
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:41,952
That's why I'm here.
I'm not moving until everybody sees me.

114
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:49,227
Are you doing anybody
besides Mark?

115
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:54,535
It's a medical question.
Because if I am,
his paranoia isn't paranoia.

116
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:57,804
It's a justified response
and therefore not a legitimate symptom.

117
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:59,970
Knew you'd understand.

118
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:03,675
On the other hand,
if it was really just a medical question,
you would have sent one of your people.

119
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:05,808
Why just push my buttons
when you can push theirs too?

120
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:10,322
Hey, Dr. Mandingo, go ask the wife
if she's been messin' around.

121
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:14,951
But you're asking
because if I am... unfaithful,

122
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:17,018
I might sleep with you.

123
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:23,994
The answer's no.
I don't sleep around.
Make sure you note that in his file.

124
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,004
Mrs. Warner.

125
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:29,564
The surgery went well.
He's in Recovery.
You can see him now.

126
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:38,110
Goldstein found nothing
but a distended bladder.

127
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:42,179
Neurogenic bladder
isn't causing the pain.

#https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurogene_Blase

128
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:45,088
It also doesn't cause
personality changes.

129
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:49,025
On the other hand,
it would completely account
for Cameron's diagnosis.

130
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,859
The patient's completely healthy.

131
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,365
Get me the video of the surgery.

132
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:11,037
Dr. Mandingo, you're needed
at the plantation house.

133
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:18,941
Well, don't everybody talk at once.

134
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:21,486
There's nothing there.

135
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:28,991
Stop looking at
the suspiciously empty bottle
and look at the screen.

136
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:31,529
Here's why I get the big bucks.

137
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:33,656
This is nothing.

138
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:36,361
An enhanced version of nothing.

139
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:40,667
This... is the problem.

140
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,871
- Unbelievable.
- Tremors in the muscle fiber.

141
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:49,881
That's not peristalsis.

142
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,213
- That's abdominal epilepsy.
- Means there's some sort
of neurological problem.

#https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominale_Epilepsie

143
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:58,913
A time bomb in his brain.

144
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:02,083
I forget.
Who said it was nothing?

145
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:13,229
I saw a very small, diffuse
abnormality in the brain waves.
Probably white matter.

146
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:15,296
Means his axonal nerves
are dying.

147
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:19,435
Explains
the neurogenic bladder.
Enough nerves die, he dies.

148
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,639
Global axonal nerve death.

149
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:23,773
Likely causes are encephalitis
or Alzheimer's.

150
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,113
Early onset Alzheimer's.
The worst.

151
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,415
He won't die right away.
He'll just want to.

152
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:31,513
I'll check the blood
for Alzheimer's protein markers.

153
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:35,492
Last I heard, Alzheimer's
had a genetic component.
Did the patient have parents?

154
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:38,121
Parents died in a car crash.
No history of dementia.

155
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:42,065
Send C.S.F. for C.B.C.
and viral serologies
to rule out encephalitis...

156
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:44,466
and get tau proteins
to check for Alzheimer's.

#https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tau-Protein
#https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer-Krankheit


157
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,062
And this still feels a little light.

158
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:51,633
I took a complete medical history.
Check out their house.
Take Sparky with you.

159
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:55,112
- They live in Short Hills. Two hours away.
- You can expense the tolls.

160
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:57,411
You're not interested
in a medical history.

161
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,974
You're a Peeping Tom
trying to spy on your ex.

162
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,986
Her secret diary--
That's the main thing.

163
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:05,490
But as long as you're there,
take a peek in the medicine cabinet.

164
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:10,154
Check for toxins, heavy metals--
anything that might explain this
other than encephalitis or Alzheimer's.

165
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:15,395
And get receipts for the tolls.

166
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:30,279
Making lunch?
I assume that's for Mark.

167
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,944
We know about his parents.
What about further back?

168
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:37,386
Grandparents, uncles, aunts.
How was their health?
Greg hates fishing.

169
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:40,357
He's got a theory.

170
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,690
Most likely candidate right now
is Alzheimer's.

171
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:53,594
No. There's been no memory loss.

172
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:56,470
I mean, he forgets
where he left his keys,
but who doesn't?

173
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,601
Any family history?

174
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:00,941
Of... whacked-outness?

175
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:04,972
His sister voted for Nader, twice.
That's about it.

176
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:12,457
You were with House
when it happened-- to his leg?

177
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,459
Oh.

178
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:18,156
You're interested in him.

179
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,255
We went on one date.

180
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:22,391
It didn't go very well.

181
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:26,564
Our first date didn't either.
I was never gonna see him again.
A week later, I moved in.

182
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,166
Five years.
What would you like to know?

183
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:34,936
What was he like before his leg?

184
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:38,015
Pretty much the same.

185
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:50,987
He's clear.
No Alzheimer's.

186
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:53,554
Yeah, that's what I figured.

187
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:07,442
Serious mountain bike.
Hasn't been used in a while though.

188
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,004
He switched to yoga.
Brand-new yoga mat and tape.

189
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:12,107
Man's getting older.
Or it might indicate back pain.

190
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:15,517
Wife would have mentioned it.
Yoga's good for picking up
the ladies too.

191
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:18,079
Not when you do it
in your own home.

192
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:21,888
Change could be just a change,
not a symptom.

193
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:25,790
Chase.

194
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:30,561
"Dear 'House' boys, a snack
for your highly illegal search.

195
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:33,196
Hope you like oatmeal raisin.
Love, Stacy".

196
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:37,038
Whoa. In a desk drawer,
hidden in the back
under some papers.

197
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:39,043
Secret stash.

198
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:43,514
Amphetamines.
Regular use could lead
to neurotoxicity.

#https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamin

199
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:47,245
Explains the axonal nerve damage
and the personality issues.

200
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:50,049
On the other hand,
"Prescribed to W. Brown".

201
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:52,147
Fake name.
Fake prescription.

202
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:55,284
Could be, but the prescribing doc,
his name's real.

203
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:59,491
This guy's just had his license pulled
for writing illegal prescriptions
to high school kids.

204
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,556
Mark's a high school
guidance counselor.

205
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:04,467
And Mr. Brown's birth date
makes him 17 years old.

206
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:08,700
Do you think maybe these
were confiscated by a high school
guidance counselor?

207
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:13,144
Anything else?
Um, yeah, he switched
from mountain biking to yoga.

208
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:15,146
- Could indicate--
- He's getting older.

209
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:19,241
- What did the C.S.F. say about encephalitis?
- Said no. Champagne tap.

210
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:22,754
No red cells, no white cells.
Serology's negative.
Which means we're back to Alzheimer's.

211
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:25,585
I told her he didn't have it.
The marker tests were negative.

212
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:28,286
Well, then you
should have told her that.
He could still have it.

213
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,852
PET scan will reveal
any changing metabolic activity
in the cerebral cortex.

214
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,764
Run him through
and check his memory.

215
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,867
We're going to
inject a chemical marker
called F.D.D.N.P.

216
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,636
- Then I'm gonna ask you a series of questions.
- Test my memory.

217
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,701
Yeah, but first we're gonna map out
some specific brain functions.

218
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,805
You know, check out the engine
before we take the car for a drive.

219
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:58,550
Checking up on me?

220
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,491
- I like all the pretty lights.
- Yeah.

221
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:17,241
Okay.
Here we go.

222
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,834
Your full name?
Mark Warner.

223
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:23,741
- Is your mother living?
- No.

224
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,182
Limbic system's intact.

225
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:29,379
Okay, say you find
a stamped envelope on the street.
What do you do?

226
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:32,913
- Find a mailbox and mail it.
- Geez. What a guy.

227
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:36,525
His frontal lobe is working
way better than mine.

228
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:39,587
Do you remember
when you got married?

229
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,963
Three years ago this July.
Who is that?

230
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:44,867
What? Could be a problem
with his long-term memory.

231
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:47,269
- Big church wedding?
- Is that House?

232
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:51,070
He remembers voices.
This serves
no diagnostic purpose.

233
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:53,634
I thought you skimped
on the limbic system there.

234
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:56,078
Emotional reactions.
I just want to be thorough.

235
00:16:56,148 --> 00:17:00,244
Did the atheistic bride
wear a pretty white dress?

236
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:03,186
Was she thinking of you?
Is that what you medically
need to know?

237
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:05,849
What jewelry did your bride wear?

238
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:09,553
She never wears any jewelry,
except the cross her mother gave to her.

239
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:12,392
No underwear either,
at least not that day.

240
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:15,524
I remember 'cause she ripped
her pretty white dress off in the car.

241
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,796
That the sort of answer
you're looking for, Doctor?

242
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,771
I think I upset him.
You gotta stop this now.

243
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:26,277
I remember the honeymoon was in Paris.
I remember 'cause we didn't leave
the room for two weeks.

244
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:29,280
- You want the details on that?
- A little defensive.

245
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:32,943
It's not paranoia
if someone's out to get you.

246
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:50,229
Here we go.

247
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,500
He's sick, paranoid, and you
keep hammering him about me?

248
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:58,475
The questions were designed
to define the operational parameters
of his limbic system.

249
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:02,412
Elevate the words all you want.
You were just screwing with him.
Low, even by your standards.

250
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,676
Medical screwing. It's what I do.

251
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,345
Then you run away like a 12-year-old.
Go hide on the roof like you always do.

252
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,650
I haven't been up here in five years.

253
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:27,864
I don't know
what's wrong with him.

254
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:33,905
It's not Alzheimer's.
It's not encephalitis.

255
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:36,447
It's not environmental.
It's not immunological.

256
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:39,177
Every test is negative
every time.

257
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:41,981
He's perfectly healthy,

258
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:44,852
but his brain is dying.

259
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:54,398
It never occurred to me...

260
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:57,629
that you couldn't figure out
what's wrong.

261
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,611
I haven't given up.

262
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,757
So what do we do?

263
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,038
We wait.

264
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,744
For what?

265
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:41,802
Something to change.

266
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:47,545
It's one of the great tragedies of life.
Something always--

267
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:51,078
Something always changes.

268
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:03,367
Nurse?

269
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,360
Nurse!

270
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:15,243
What happened?
What's wrong?

271
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:19,774
My toes-- They were numb,
tingling, then nothing.

272
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:21,614
No pain. Nothing.

273
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:23,746
It's okay. They're going
to take care of you.

274
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:25,983
I'm scared, Stacy.
Hold my hand.

275
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:31,862
What?

276
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,969
What's happening?

277
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:46,943
Time marches on.
He's paralyzed.

278
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:01,289
His symptoms mimic
a peripheral nervous system
under attack.

#https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheres_Nervensystem

279
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,660
But he's experiencing
significant paresthesias,
and he can't move his hands or toes.

280
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:07,665
It's peripheral.

281
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:10,327
Guillain-Barré syndrome
attacks there, not the brain.

282
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:13,132
No. No. I already did
an indirect Coombs' test.

#https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coombs-Test

283
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:15,196
No agglutination, no antibodies.

284
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,139
Initiative. Like that.

285
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:19,268
Start him on I.V. immuno--

286
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:22,745
No antibodies means
he doesn't have Guillain-Barré, period.

287
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:25,112
Period?
More like dot, dot, dot.

288
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:27,674
What if he has the virus
but isn't producing
those antibodies?

289
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:32,122
Come on. The chances of that--
Didn't ask about the Vegas line.
I said "what if".

290
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,591
It would mean he's sick,
and his body's not doing
anything about it.

291
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:38,596
So we either fight it for him
or it's fatal.

292
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,655
Fatal sounds very bad to me.

293
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:44,224
Well, without the antibodies,
we can't even test for it.
Don't know if we're right.

294
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:49,662
Treatment isn't all that dangerous.
Plasmapheresis and I.V.I.G.

295
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:55,543
If it works, we're right.
If he dies... it was something else.

296
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,643
So the paralysis
might not be permanent.

297
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:05,849
That's our hope,
but the brain's tricky.
You never know.

298
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:11,593
What was that?
What?

299
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:15,599
- With the head. The look.
- He just wants to talk to me.

300
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:19,728
- Well, if it was medical,
he should be talking to me.
- I'll be just outside the door.

301
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:22,035
Leave! Go talk to him.

302
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:26,441
- You're going to leave me anyway.
- No. That's not gonna happen.

303
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:30,447
You left him, and he had a limp.
If I can't walk or hold you?

304
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:33,541
Honey, I'm not going anywhere.
I'm not going to talk to him.

305
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:37,418
- If I can't feed myself?
- Mark, what you're feeling--
It's not real. It's the virus.

306
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,953
- Mark? What is it?
- Mark?

307
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:46,259
His throat's closing up.
He can't breathe. Code blue! Hurry!

308
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:49,129
He's having a reaction to the I.V.I.G.
I need epi, stat.

309
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:54,101
- I can't get the scope in his throat.
- Stop that.

310
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:56,732
- He's having an allergic reaction. He's crashing.
- No, he's not. Look at his vitals.

311
00:22:56,808 --> 00:22:59,834
O2 sats are within range.

312
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:02,471
I'm betting the only abnormal sign
is sweaty palms.

313
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:06,981
Push two milligrams Ativan.

314
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:22,930
No allergic reaction.
Just a panic attack.

315
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:26,937
Something obviously freaked him out.

316
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,841
Can we talk now?

317
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:35,579
You couldn't just come
into the room?

318
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:39,413
He's had five visitors drive down.
I didn't recognize any of them.

319
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:42,647
Six more have sent him flowers,
candy and a teddy bear,

320
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:45,155
which I'm sure he finds
very comforting.

321
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:47,691
But I didn't recognize any
of the names on the cards.

322
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,125
Shockingly, Mark has friends,
and I have some new ones.

323
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:53,289
No, it's not shocking
that you have new friends,

324
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:56,266
but it is shocking that you apparently
dumped all your old ones.

325
00:23:56,334 --> 00:24:01,135
- I haven't.
- No, I didn't think so.

326
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:04,505
I just think you didn't tell any of them
that you were down here.

327
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:06,806
Now, why would that be?

328
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:11,580
What are you up to?
It's gonna take a little while.

329
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:15,849
Why would you not tell
your oldest friends...

330
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:20,381
that you were taking Mark
to Princeton Plainsboro Teaching
Hospital to try to save his life?

331
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,791
I've been busy. I haven't kept track
of who knows what.

332
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:26,957
See, my old friends
are telling me to be careful.
They seem to think--

333
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:29,193
He.
And he sent me the bear.

334
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:31,758
Figures.

335
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:36,069
He seems to think
that I'm not over you...

336
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:41,041
and that it might be dangerous for me
to spend time with you.

337
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:45,549
I'm thinking your friends
might have similar concerns,

338
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:47,710
and so you didn't tell them
you'd be here with me.

339
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:50,277
What's your point?
That I'm still in love with you?

340
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:53,347
I should abandon my dying husband,
and we should head for Rio.

341
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:57,819
No.

342
00:24:57,896 --> 00:25:02,026
Greg, I appreciate
what you're doing for us,
but I think maybe Wilson's right.

343
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,831
Maybe you should
just stay away from me.

344
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,771
What's up?

345
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:51,111
Love the bear.
It's adorable.

346
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:54,583
My wife's gonna kill me.
We're having company.
She cooked.

347
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:56,985
I got Mark's latest blood work.

348
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:59,922
He's not responding
to treatment.

349
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,494
I'm sorry.

350
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:06,122
I was happy.

351
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,897
He's my patient.

352
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:16,134
I'm sure he's a good guy.
He's probably a great guy.

353
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:18,607
He's apparently
a much better guy than I am.

354
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:23,078
And some part of me
wants him to die.

355
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:32,980
I'm just not sure if it's because...
I want to be with her,

356
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:36,721
or it's because
I want her to suffer.

357
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,937
Hey. Is it okay if I talk
to Stacy for a minute?

358
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:57,170
I'll be just outside, honey.

359
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:07,151
You two are good together.

360
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:09,523
You know nothing about Mark.

361
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:11,653
He took you to Paris.

362
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,721
That's good enough for me.

363
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,794
We never went to Paris.

364
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:23,803
Your honeymoon.
It's been your dream city.

365
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:27,811
You wanted to go since you were 16.
He actually took you.
No, I had to work.

366
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:32,748
We spent the night in New York.
Then we went back to Short Hills.
What is it?

367
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:36,913
When did Mark switch
from mountain biking to yoga?

368
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:39,149
About a month ago.

369
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:41,715
The same time
he started getting sick.
What does that mean?

370
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:44,284
We have two more symptoms.

371
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:50,832
The patient was asked
a series of questions to determine
the functionality of his brain.

372
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:54,599
- You grilled him about Stacy.
- Whatever.

373
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:58,370
Yeah, the point is, he told us everything
we need to know to diagnose him.

374
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:01,503
That is, if we use your fancy PET scan
as a lie detector.

375
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:03,570
See, it's a very creative process,
lying.

376
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:08,017
Now, telling the truth
is a much simpler process.
See here.

377
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:12,887
Question nine. This is where Mark
gives a long, rambling answer
about taking Stacy to Paris.

378
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:17,189
- What does the PET scan say?
- Minimal involvement.
Just the frontal and temporal lobes.

379
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:20,425
He said he went to Paris,
and the PET confirms it.
So, what?

380
00:28:20,498 --> 00:28:23,296
They didn't go.

381
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:26,303
They didn't go to Paris,
and yet Mark's brain
apparently thinks...

382
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:30,102
that he really did spend 40 francs
on a tour of the bastille.

383
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:34,271
So we have an intermittent syndrome
that presents with abdominal pain,

384
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:37,143
polyneuropathy, paranoia...

385
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:40,616
and delusions.

386
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:44,212
Now, here's the thing
about Acute Intermittent Porphyria.

387
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:47,747
It'll jump you in a dark alley,
beat the crap out of you,
leave you bleeding.

388
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:50,522
But it wears gloves,
so no fingerprints.

389
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:54,292
Doesn't show up in blood tests,
urine tests, nothing...

390
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:57,596
unless you catch it red-handed
in the middle of an attack.

391
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:00,832
But there are other
symptoms of A.I.P.

392
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,339
- Such as?
- Light sensitivity.

393
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:06,400
Yeah. One of the true tragedies
of this condition...

394
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:09,641
is it makes you want to stick
your cool new mountain bike
in the garage...

395
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:12,114
and take up an indoor sport
like, say, yoga.

396
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:15,118
Start the treatment.
Hematin and glucose.

397
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:18,417
If you give him Hematin now
and you're wrong, he dies today.

398
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:22,085
There's only one way to confirm A.I.P.--
urine sample made during the attack.

399
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,788
And there's no way to predict
when he'll have another attack.

400
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:27,354
Sure there is.

401
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:30,868
Acute Intermittent Porphyria
has very specific triggers.

402
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:35,031
Barbiturates, alcohol,
high levels of protein
will set off an attack.

403
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:38,701
Which trigger
do you think set off Mark's?
Not the faintest idea.

404
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:42,008
That's why I'm gonna give him
the combo plate. All of it.

405
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,880
So if he has this,
and you trigger an attack,
the attack makes him worse, right?

406
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:49,351
Yeah. But then we'll know what it is
and we can treat it.

407
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:57,557
But if I don't have this thing
and you give me that shot,
what happens?

408
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:03,193
No idea. If we don't know
what's messing up your brain,
we don't know how you'll react.

409
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:11,000
Okay, I-- I need a minute
with my husband.

410
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,376
He doesn't want the trigger.

411
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:51,040
He wants to wait,
see if we can come up
with another explanation.

412
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:54,845
If it is A.I.P.,
how much time does he have?

413
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:58,753
No idea.
Next attack could be fatal.

414
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:01,451
Could be six months from now.
Could be five minutes from now.

415
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:05,292
I want you to test him.
Fine.

416
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,854
I'll send for
an H.M.B.-synthase mutation.

#https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porphobilinogen_deaminase  HMBS

417
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:10,730
Genetic test.
Lab will get back to us in a month.

418
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:13,362
Give him the cocktail,
set off an attack.

419
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:15,963
No.
Why not?

420
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,133
Because he doesn't want me to.

421
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,700
I'm not gonna sue you.
I'm not gonna report you.

422
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:22,712
He might.
He's paralyzed.

423
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:25,544
Either you cure him,
or he won't be writing any letters.

424
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:27,778
I'm not gonna do it.
Why not?

425
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:30,218
You keep asking me that question.
My answer doesn't change.

426
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:33,257
I gave him the parameters.
It's his call.

427
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:39,254
You want him to die.
I diagnosed him.
I did my job.

428
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:44,131
You want somebody to tie him down
and force him into treatment,
you're way better at that than I am.

429
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:48,468
Is that what this is? Payback for your leg?
How many times have we been over this?
I saved your life.

430
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:52,771
Yeah, maybe.
You're gonna kill my husband
to teach me a lesson?

431
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:55,438
No. He's gonna die
'cause he's too stubborn
to make the right choice.

432
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:57,674
Now we're in your territory.

433
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:02,545
I'm respecting your husband's decision.
I don't see why you've got
a problem with that.

434
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,588
Because it's crap.

435
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:07,591
Because you browbeat patients,
intimidate them, lie to them.

436
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:10,651
If you think you're right,
you don't give a damn what they think.

437
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:13,959
I did what you do all the time.
The only difference is, I did it to you.

438
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:21,866
He'll never forgive you.

439
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:25,836
Yeah. He will.

440
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,781
Still no change.
He's not getting worse?

441
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:45,386
- No. No change at all.
- And that's consistent with A.I.P., right?

442
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:48,796
Until he has another attack,
his condition's stable.
Yeah.

443
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:53,496
- Mark, you've got to.
- I don't want to take that test,
not until they're sure.

444
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:56,062
- You don't know Greg.
- Not like you do.

445
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,240
I only met him
when he drugged me.

446
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,904
Boy, are my ears burning.

447
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,006
- What's that?
- Cocktail hour.

448
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:08,018
Just 'cause you can't hoist a few
doesn't mean you should be left out.

449
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:11,852
- Get away from me.
- Mark, if this is what he thinks
is wrong with you--

450
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:14,187
You trust his judgment
more than mine?
His medical judgment.

451
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:16,317
And you'd bet my life on that?
I would.

452
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:18,089
I don't.

453
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,824
Smart.

454
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:23,389
It's too bad you're paralyzed.

455
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:34,605
Bing!
Paging Dr. Foreman.

456
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:39,382
Leave the room.
It's not your problem.
You need the consent from him.

457
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:42,783
But, Doc,
he ain't right in the head.
Then you need a court order.

458
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:46,790
Okay. Then get one.
We'll wait here. I won't do nothin'.

459
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:53,587
Oh! Love the Musketeer thing.

460
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:56,633
- I got goose bumps.
- Give me the syringe.

461
00:33:56,701 --> 00:34:01,536
Please. If you're right,
this may be his only shot.

462
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:05,269
So what's your plan?
You take the big dark one,
I've got the little girl,

463
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:08,141
and the Aussie
will run like a scared wombat
if things turn rough.

464
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:18,255
I can't do it.

465
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,459
You son of a bitch!

466
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:32,730
See what I did there?

467
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:40,910
- When does it happen?
- If he had A.I.P.,
should've already happened.

468
00:34:40,978 --> 00:34:43,344
- Everyone's different.
- This is not good.

469
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:46,577
He could have an embolism,
tachycardia, stroke.

470
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:48,642
What's happening?
Two milligrams of Ativan.

471
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,085
Is that an attack?

472
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,457
- Here.
- No. You'll pollute the sample.

473
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:59,121
- Chase, get urine from the catheter.
- It's not an attack! He's stroking.

474
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:01,097
He needs Ativan!

475
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:04,862
This is not a stroke.
The delta-wave burst
is just a vasospasm.

476
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:08,804
- Catheter's out.
There's no way to collect the sample.
- Heart rate's in the 40s. Bradycardia.

477
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:11,364
- We're losing him.
- Hold him down.
- Give him something!

478
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:14,002
No painkillers.
You were wrong.

479
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:26,820
Straight from the bladder.
That's as fresh as it gets.

480
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:29,724
Would you give him the Ativan already?

481
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:33,321
He doesn't need
to be awake for this.

482
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:58,186
It's still yellow.

483
00:35:58,256 --> 00:36:00,417
Move.

484
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:04,587
- What?
- You think another light's
gonna make the difference?

485
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:08,325
Organic chem--
more light, more oxidation.

486
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:10,390
Does that ring any bells?

487
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:24,137
Start the patient
on 150 milligrams glucose,
75 milligrams Hematin.

488
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:54,834
Hey.
Hey.

489
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:57,938
You wanna thumb wrestle?

490
00:36:58,015 --> 00:37:00,006
Come on.
Oh!

491
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,220
He's still a maniac.
I know.

492
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:32,178
Dr. House?

493
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,241
How's he doing?

494
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,022
Never better.

495
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,919
I thought...

496
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:49,763
you were too screwed up
to love anyone.

497
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:51,825
I was wrong.

498
00:37:53,537 --> 00:37:56,768
You just couldn't love me.

499
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,434
That's good.

500
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,272
I'm happy for you.

501
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:52,654
You fixed him.

502
00:38:54,565 --> 00:38:56,760
De nada.

503
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,768
Thank you.

504
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:02,496
You were right.

505
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:04,404
He's gonna be fine.

506
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:06,466
No. About me.

507
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,280
I'm not over you.

508
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:17,211
You were-- You were the one.

509
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:19,222
You always will be.

510
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,251
But I can't be with you.

511
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:36,429
So I'm the guy,

512
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:39,499
but you want the other guy,

513
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:42,705
who, by definition,
can never be the guy.

514
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:47,916
What's so great about you
is you always think you're right.

515
00:39:47,985 --> 00:39:52,081
And what's so frustrating
about you is you are right
so much of the time.

516
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:57,060
You are brilliant,

517
00:39:57,128 --> 00:40:00,461
funny, surprising, sexy.

518
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:10,502
But with you, I was lonely.
And with Mark, there's room for me.

519
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:16,944
Okay.

520
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:04,853
I want to run something by you.

521
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:07,796
I will not have sex with you!
Not again.

522
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:10,390
It was miserable
that first time.

523
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,561
All that desperate
administrative need.

524
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:17,039
Stacy's husband is going to need
close monitoring at the hospital,

525
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:19,598
and since we can definitely
use her back here,

526
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:22,840
I've offered her a job--
general counsel.

527
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,915
Did she say yes?

528
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:30,010
She said only if
it was okay with you.

529
00:41:32,122 --> 00:41:34,056
Yes or no?

530
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:43,192
Fine. Good.
