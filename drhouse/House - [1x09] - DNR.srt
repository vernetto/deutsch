1
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:11,074
This is a really nice room.

2
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:13,442
Yeah, it sounds thick.
Too bad he's not coming.

3
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:16,573
Look, I talked to him myself.
He'll be here.
Right.

4
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:20,745
You're the one who said
that the song could use a horn part,
so I got the best-- John Henry.

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,051
You think I'm stupid?
Ofcourse I do,
but that's not the point.

6
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:26,058
He'll be here, okay?

7
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:35,997
Take a left up ahead.

8
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:39,266
South Street?
I canceled this gig.

9
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:41,773
You said you didn't want
to do any sessions for a while.

10
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:44,810
For a while.
I called her. I uncanceled it.

11
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,905
- Are you up to it?
- Let's find out.

12
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:53,142
# You lied to me #

13
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:57,246
# John Henry's
never gonna show up ##
Will you stop?

14
00:00:57,323 --> 00:01:01,020
It's been, like, two hours.
And we will keep waiting.

15
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:03,528
You've heard this guy play,
and you know what he does,

16
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:06,087
so can you just shut up, Tommy?

17
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:11,800
- Oh, my God.
- Am I late?

18
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:24,183
You need to hear it again?
Nope. I get it.

19
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,413
Let's try one. See what we get.
Let's do it.

20
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:02,618
John! You okay?

21
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,285
You okay?
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

22
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,953
Call an ambulance!

23
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:11,326
Now!

24
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:58,943
I want in.

25
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:03,839
- John Henry Giles? You a fan of his music?
- He's a musician?

26
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:08,385
That paralysis thing--
Guy can't walk for two years.

27
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:10,922
Nobody knows why.
It seems mildly interesting.

28
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:14,153
- Forget his paralysis.
- Tell that to the rest of his bowling team.

29
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:17,993
As far as this hospital is concerned,
this is a simple case of lobar pneumonia.

30
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:21,329
- Boring.
- But that not-walking thing--
That could turn into something serious.

31
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:26,964
Marty Hamilton is his
primary physician out in California.
He's dealing with the paralysis.

32
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,804
Know all about it.
Multiple treatments, multiple surgeries--

33
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,344
He's making real progress.
Fixed everything but the legs.

34
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:34,937
Dr. Hamilton already called
and asked for your team.

35
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:38,506
And by team, I don't mean you.

36
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,746
Like I always say, there's no "I" in team.

37
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,311
There is a "me" though,
if you jumble it up.

38
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,582
Foreman did his residency
with Hamilton.

39
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:49,787
I know. I accidentally glanced
at his résumé before I hired him.

40
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:51,887
He wants someone he can trust.

41
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:53,899
He must've spoken
to Foreman's parole officer.

42
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:56,401
Someone who will stick
to the pneumonia.

43
00:03:56,469 --> 00:04:00,132
John Henry's on an experimental
protocol for the paralysis.
I respect that.

44
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:03,835
I'm not gonna get in his way.
It's Foreman's case.

45
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,071
It's pneumonia. He can handle it.

46
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:08,807
Guy's already paralyzed.
How badly can he screw it up?

47
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,364
So,

48
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,333
- what are his sats?
- Staying in the 90s
on the nasal cannula.

49
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:32,337
- Coughing up sputum?
- Almost none.
He seems stabilized.

50
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:36,239
- Dr. House, is there
anything back from micro?
- Not yet. You gonna fire me?

51
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:39,870
- You can make up for it
by washing my car.
- Oh, this is fun.

52
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,346
Okay. Let's keep him on
the broad-spectrum antibiotics.

53
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:44,679
And since he's displaying
septic physiology,

54
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:47,845
draw blood for adrenal
and thyroid function.

55
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,420
- What about the paralysis?
- We're sticking to the pneumonia.

56
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:56,258
Well, you certainly are, boss,
like a wet tongue sticks to dry ice.

57
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:58,957
The paralysis has already been
diagnosed by Dr. Hamilton.

58
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:01,398
- It's A.L.S.
- Lou Gehrig's disease.

59
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:04,129
It's a lovely diagnosis.
They make movies about it.

60
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:07,104
No tests, no treatment--
It's a disease of exclusion.

61
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:09,971
- Because Hamilton has
excluded everything else.
- I haven't.

62
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:17,306
What else could it be?

63
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:20,045
- Guillain-Barré,
which would be reversible.
- Excellent.

64
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:24,249
No. The progression of the paralysis
would be symmetric. His wasn't.

65
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,952
- Transverse myelitis.
- Hamilton tested for it. Negative.

66
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:29,324
And he was negative
for masses and A.V.M.--

67
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:33,297
- Antibodies could be attacking the nerves.
Multifocal motor neuropathy.
- Uncommon, but it fits.

68
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:36,858
It's also treatable.
Did Hamilton try
putting the guy on I.V.I.G.?

69
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:40,337
- No, because the M.R.I. showed no--
- Well, let's do an M.R.I. of our own.

70
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,311
Guys, it's my case.

71
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:52,417
A.L.S. fits.
It even predicts the pneumonia.
The paralysis is progressive.

72
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:56,785
It's a death sentence.
That doesn't make it wrong.

73
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:17,835
So you think the breathing stuff
is connected to my A.L.S.?

74
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,003
It makes sense.

75
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:24,272
So it's just gonna get worse, huh?

76
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,284
- Well, Dr. Hamilton--
- Great guy.

77
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:30,015
Really smart doctor,
and his treatment obviously isn't working.

78
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,991
Do you think I'm gonna die here,
or you think I get to go back home first?

79
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:40,396
An M.R.I. would give us a better idea--
Oh, an M.R.I. Come on.
For pneumonia?

80
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:42,832
Dr. House thinks
we should test for other--
House?

81
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:47,032
Yeah, I heard about him.
Obsessive son of a bitch?
That's him.

82
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:52,300
So who do you think is right,
Hamilton or House?

83
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:54,676
Hey, they're both
excellent physicians.

84
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,681
Come on.

85
00:06:56,749 --> 00:07:00,378
One of 'em says A.L.S.
The other one says not A.L.S.

86
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:02,387
You gotta pick one, son.

87
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:05,822
Everything points to A.L.S.

88
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:08,417
Then no M.R.I.

89
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:17,599
And I want one of them papers
that say, uh, I don't want nothing done
if something go bad.

90
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:21,504
A D.N.R.? Mr. Giles,
you don't want to rush into--

91
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:25,066
It's been two years. I ain't rushin'.
I want to sign one.

92
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,904
Now.

93
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:32,073
While my arm still works.

94
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:59,206
He signed a D.N.R.

95
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:04,110
He rhymes with dinner?

96
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:06,743
He signed a D.N.R.

97
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,879
Oh. That makes more sense.

98
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,915
- You tell him
it might not be A.L.S.?
- No.

99
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,285
Well, no wonder he signed.
Who wouldn't?

100
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:20,389
I started him on
I.V. steroids and Synthroid.

101
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:25,130
Great. If it was my case,
I'd be adding a little I.V.I.G. to the mix.

102
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:28,731
- For his pneumonia?
- That's my story, and I'm sticking to it.

103
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,573
He doesn't want anything done.
No treatment.

104
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:38,174
D.N.R. means "Do not resuscitate",
not "Do not treat".

105
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:41,379
You do nothing, doesn't matter
which one of us is right.

106
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:46,124
And hang on to that D.N.R.

107
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,592
That signature could be worth
a lot of money real soon.

108
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:59,269
This is Dr. Foreman.
What is Mr. Giles's status?

109
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:02,774
Okay. Increase the steroids
to 100 milligrams
every 12 hours and, uh--

110
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:06,005
start him on I.V.I.G.

111
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,603
Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure.
One gram per kilo.

112
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,708
My nature isn't what it used to be.

113
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:15,117
The little man has lost
some bounce in his step.

114
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:19,385
He needs to crank it up,
have himself some fun this weekend.

115
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:23,827
He wants the blue pills.
You're taking about your penis
in the third person.

116
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,126
Me and him-- two people.

117
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:29,326
Separate vacations?
That'd be a drag for one of you.

118
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:33,463
I don't think you need the pills.
I think you have a conflict in medications.

119
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:38,238
- You need to up your insulin
to chocolate chip ice-cream levels.
- Insulin?

120
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:40,973
Yeah. You remember.
That's the stuff you take for the diabetes...

121
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:43,481
that you forgot
to tell the nurse about.

122
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:46,211
Your hands--

123
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:49,345
No hair, which means nerve damage.

124
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:53,654
And your shoes look about
two sizes too small, which means
you've lost sensation in your feet.

125
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:55,557
And then there's your pants.

126
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:59,189
My pants tell you
I have diabetes?
No. They tell me you're an idiot.

127
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,894
Powdered sugar
on the right pant leg.

128
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:04,834
Based on the two napkins
in your pocket--

129
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:07,600
I'd bet it's not your first
doughnut of the day.

130
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,710
You're giving me the pills?
Sure. Why not?

131
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:23,118
If you've got heart disease
from ignoring the diabetes,
they'll kill you.

132
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,717
Otherwise,
you two have a fun weekend.

133
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,302
O2 sats are dropping.

134
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,962
- Breath sounds?
- Junky.

135
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:40,801
Mucus plug?
No, it's our mistake.

136
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:43,239
Sludging from the I. V.I.G.
Blood can't get to his lungs.

137
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,608
Start heparin-- 500 c.c.'s I.V. push.
He won't last long enough
for it to work.

138
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:49,045
We've got to intubate him stat.

139
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:51,481
We can't. He's D.N.R.

140
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,484
What?

141
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:03,695
Someone likes music.
Oh, yeah.

142
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:12,932
- His sats are in the 70s.
How long's he been like this?
- Ten minutes.

143
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,473
- Why aren't you--
- The I.V.I.G. put him in respiratory failure.

144
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,975
- You put him on I.V.I.G.?
- We did this.

145
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:20,569
So undo it. Chase?

146
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:23,342
- It's too late. We killed him.
- Nobody killed him. He's not dead.

147
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:26,180
- Chase, intubate him.
- He's D.N.R.

148
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,864
What are you doin'?

149
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:46,464
You can't do this!

150
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:50,336
- Bag.
- You can't do this.

151
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:52,536
Bag!

152
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:02,112
He had a bad reaction
to some medicine we gave him.

153
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:05,021
What did you just do?

154
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:08,052
He saved his life.

155
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:25,132
He's stable on the ventilator,
oxygenating well.

156
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:27,543
The I.V.I.G. made him worse,

157
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:31,071
which means
multifocal motor neuropathy
was a bad diagnosis.

158
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,812
Okay, what's really wrong with him?
What's wrong with you?

159
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:36,821
Everyone knows what's wrong with me.
What's wrong with him is more interesting.

160
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:40,985
You tubed him,
and he didn't want to be tubed.
He has a legal paper saying just that.

161
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,223
To intubate or not to intubate--
That is the big ethical question.

162
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:47,561
Actually, I was hoping we could avoid it
and maybe just practice some medicine.

163
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:50,329
There is no question.
It's the patient's decision.

164
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:52,336
If the patient is competent to make it.

165
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:56,033
- If his thyroid numbers
aren't making him sad.
- Oh, my God. You don't believe that.

166
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:59,908
- His thyroid levels were a little--
- It's nothing. Do not defend him!

167
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:02,709
- Why did he sign that D.N.R.?
- I-I didn't talk him into--

168
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:07,048
No. He signed the D.N.R.
'cause he didn't want
a slow, painful death from A.L.S.

169
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:10,577
- What was happening had
nothing to do with his A.L.S.
- Exactly! It's the I.V.I.G.

170
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:14,888
You screwed up!
You're not gonna let him die
because you screwed up.

171
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,653
Technically, your case.
You screwed up.

172
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:22,360
- Is that what this is about--
looking bad in front of your old boss?

173
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:25,198
You assaulted that man.
Fine. I'll never do it again.

174
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:27,603
Yes, you will.
All the more reason
this debate is pointless.

175
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:37,247
His lungs are worse.
Any theories?

176
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:41,343
Oh, I'm sure he just went
to the little boys' room.
Come on, people.

177
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,787
- Um, vasculitis?
- Wouldn't likely hit both lungs.

178
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:47,587
It could be
Wegener's granulomatosis.

179
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,595
Dr. House?

180
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,530
Cuddy sent me a stripper again?

181
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,794
Love that woman. So thoughtful.

182
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:57,597
Sorry.

183
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:02,770
There are case reports of Wegener's
hitting both the lungs and the spine.

184
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:06,369
Well, it's not great,
but it's better than A.L.S.
At least it's treatable.

185
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:09,710
It's a restraining order.
You're not to come within
50 feet of John Henry Giles,

186
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,580
and they've asked the D.A. to file
criminal charges for battery.

187
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,516
Cameron, test the blood for C-ANCA.

188
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:21,082
These are criminal charges.
They're not gonna let you
take blood to make more tests.

189
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,993
He has blood left in the lab.
Just add on the C-ANCA.

190
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:27,794
- Foreman still got you doing bronchoscopic
suctioning for the pneumonia?
- Every four hours.

191
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:32,634
Well, while you're down
in his lungs, grab a biopsy.
We'll need it to confirm Wegener's.

192
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,401
- And move the patient
to the second floor I.C.U.
- Why?

193
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:39,103
It's right above the clinic.
I'm pretty sure it's 50 feet
in any direction.

194
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:43,114
It's nice having a court order saying
you don't have to work clinic duty.

195
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,993
Dr. Cuddy!
Excuse me.

196
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,331
You paged me.
Why the yelling?

197
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:11,069
His bed is behind that wall--
the plaintiff's.

198
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:13,304
I can't, you know,
come any closer.

199
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:17,275
It's right over the clinic.
Very cute.

200
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:20,216
Can we get the lecture over with
'cause I've gotta--

201
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,687
Actually, I've got nothing to do.
Take your time.

202
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,350
You need a lawyer?

203
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,916
You don't have a problem
with what I did?

204
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:34,762
When I hired you, I knew you were insane.
I will continue to try and stop you
from doing insane things.

205
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,994
But once they're done,

206
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:42,530
trying to convince an insane person
not to do insane things
is in itself insane.

207
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,975
So when I hired you,
I also set aside $50,000 a year
for legal expenses.

208
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:50,140
So far you've come in under budget.

209
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:53,981
Great. Any chance you could
help me run some tests?

210
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:56,681
Dr. Foreman called Dr. Hamilton.

211
00:15:56,755 --> 00:16:00,589
He's flying in from L.A.
You can talk to him.

212
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:04,993
Dr. Hamilton is flying in
as a friend of John Henry's...

213
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:08,156
to pull the plug.

214
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:15,162
Yeah. I need a lawyer.

215
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:21,913
Your Honor,
on behalf of Gregory House,

216
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,506
we have convened
an emergency session of this court...

217
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:28,747
to bring a motion requesting that
John Henry Giles remain on life support.

218
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:32,951
Mr. House faces criminal charges
for battery against...

219
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:36,288
John Henry Giles.

220
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:38,353
You beat up a guy in a wheelchair?

221
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:44,369
Dr. House is alleged to have forced a tube
down Mr. Giles's throat against his will.

222
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:47,735
A medical tube, saving his life.

223
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:50,707
Dr. House, please let
your attorney speak for you.

224
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,745
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
I was way out of line.

225
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:02,051
So, uh, your client forced the patient
into this position,

226
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:07,388
and now he wants a court order
to force the patient to stay that way.

227
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:11,156
Without the tube,
there's a high likelihood
that Mr. Giles will die.

228
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,393
Well, I assume the patient knows that.
He had a D.N.R.

229
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:17,264
That's why your client is
facing criminal charges, right?

230
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:23,138
Exactly. And Mr. Giles's death
will violate my client's
Sixth Amendment right.

231
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:28,145
His right to face his accuser.
That's clever, huh?

232
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:31,910
Your Honor, in Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania v. Hoselton,

233
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:36,478
the Third District ruled that a defendant
may not use that status to rule against--

234
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,420
Why are you doing this?

235
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,788
It's not gonna
keep you out of jail.
No.

236
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:46,024
Even if you win, the restraining order
and battery charge stay in place,
so what have you gained?

237
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:47,531
Time.

238
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,760
To diagnose him?
You can't get near him.

239
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:52,360
I don't want to be near him.

240
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:56,374
Well, some doctors have
the messiah complex.
They need to save the world.

241
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:59,536
You've got the Rubik's complex.
You need to solve the puzzle.

242
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:03,479
Are you done? Or do you have
more references to 1980s' fads?

243
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:06,313
I'm trying to listen to this.

244
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,580
That D.N.R. may not be valid.

245
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:12,385
The patient was suffering
from depression brought on
by a thyroid imbalance.

246
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,052
The D.N.R. order was witnessed...

247
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:19,120
by Dr. House's own staff,
a-- a-- a Dr. Foreman.

248
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:22,793
My staff are idiots.
I'm sure you know
what it's like, Your Honor.

249
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:25,428
Sit down.

250
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:31,870
The validity of the D.N.R.
is a question of fact.

251
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:35,675
Dr. House should have the opportunity
to make his argument at a full trial.

252
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:40,582
And this poor guy
has got to stay on life support
until we can schedule a trial.

253
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:43,644
- Your Honor--
- Dr. House,

254
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:46,987
I will hold you in contempt
if you don't sit down.

255
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:49,892
- I have a medical issue.
- If it pertains to this case, your attorney--

256
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,863
It doesn't.

257
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:55,399
Do you have any history
of heart disease in your family?

258
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:58,163
- Your Honor!
- Your fingers--

259
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:00,705
They show signs of clubbing,
which indicates a heart problem.

260
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:05,607
Remember Bart Giamatti?
Same thing-- Just dropped dead one day.

261
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:09,044
- Please see your doctor.
- He's admitted this isn't relevant.

262
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:12,777
Can we get back to the motion?

263
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:16,048
- Ofcourse. I-I'm sorry.
- Your Honor,

264
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:20,387
a person's right to control
the treatment of their own body...

265
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:23,189
is fundamental
to understanding this case.

266
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:26,891
A long line of cases,
both federal and state, stand to--

267
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:30,901
Congratulations.
Impressive legal argument.

268
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:33,460
I watched Matlock last night.
Say no more.

269
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:36,872
I didn't notice any clubbing
on the judge's fingers.
Neither did I.

270
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:38,933
So the family history thing--

271
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,479
Every family has some history
of heart disease.

272
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:43,481
And mental illness.

273
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:51,149
Biopsy only shows inflammation.
Start him on Cytoxan.

274
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:53,817
You're diagnosing Wegener's
based on a little inflammation?

275
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:56,986
Well, unfortunately,
I think we've exhausted
all the tests we can do...

276
00:19:57,062 --> 00:20:00,554
in our capacity as the doctors
that he doesn't want doing tests on him.
Well, you don't--

277
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:04,329
We'll know I'm right if he starts walking.
We can't do any more tests,
but you want me to treat him?

278
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:07,895
Medicine's in the pharmacy.
Patient's immobilized in the I.C.U.

279
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:10,635
Sounds like
a simple geography problem.

280
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:15,474
Are you asking us to jeopardize
our medical licenses for this treatment?

281
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,198
Can I help you?

282
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:45,266
Uh, I'm Dr. House. I--

283
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:48,006
Greg, right? I'm Marty Hamilton,
John Henry's doctor.

284
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:52,650
We should talk.

285
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:58,956
Appreciate any list of, uh, medications--
anything like that.

286
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:01,686
I've started him on Cytoxan.

287
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,751
For Wegener's, right?

288
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:05,888
Look, Greg.

289
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:08,023
I checked you out, you know?

290
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,467
I know you're a good doctor,
and you have to appreciate
that I'm a good doctor too.

291
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:15,097
Why?
Wegener's is one
of the first things I looked for.

292
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:17,903
The biopsy and the blood test
were negative, just like yours.

293
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:20,240
There's an error rate, Marty.

294
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:22,371
And there's a time to let go.

295
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:28,216
Look, I'm gonna take him off the ventilator,
and John Henry's going to die.
He's accepted that.

296
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,882
Dr. Hamilton.
Hey.

297
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,255
How you doin'?
Hey, how you doin'?

298
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:37,762
- I'm sorry. I should have never
put your patient on I.V.I.G.
- It's not your fault, Eric.

299
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:42,027
- No, it's mine, Eric.
- That's not what I said.

300
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,501
- Everybody asks about you out in L.A.
- How's the old place doin'?

301
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,765
Oh, this is wonderful.

302
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:52,606
But before you guys break out the oil,
I should point out that you can't
pull the plug. I have a court order.

303
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:56,013
You used to, but--

304
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:58,208
I have the right to face my accuser.
Judge said so.

305
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:02,515
Not if no one's accusing you.
All the charges have been dropped.

306
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:11,219
He doesn't have to die.

307
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:16,033
It's not Wegener's.

308
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:34,179
If it's Wegener's,
his lungs won't be able to handle it.

309
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:37,244
Soon as they pull that plug,
he'll die.

310
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:40,382
That's why they call it
"pulling the plug".

311
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:03,044
I'm gonna miss you.

312
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:43,944
- He's still breathing.
- His O2 sats are holding.

313
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:52,728
- He's holding his own.
- He's still breathing.

314
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:54,732
It's not Wegener's.

315
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:05,641
Wrong again.

316
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:11,741
He's stable, but one of his arms
is now paralyzed.

317
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:14,547
The real question is,
why is he still alive?

318
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,883
Do you think
he's just being stubborn?

319
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,617
He's alive because you were wrong.
It's not Wegener's.

320
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:23,752
Yeah. Seem to be doing that a lot lately.
People keep living because of my mistakes.

321
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:27,287
Progression of the paralysis
pretty much confirmed
Hamilton was right. It's A.L.S.

322
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:30,630
- Assuming this is
a progression of his paralysis.
- He can't move his arm.

323
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:34,001
Yes, his arm is paralyzed.
Yes, his legs are paralyzed.

324
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:37,906
Why is everyone so gung ho
to connect those two conditions?

325
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:40,240
You can think I'm wrong,
but that's no reason to stop thinking.

326
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:44,339
- How about this one?
He's not our patient.
- Nope. Not good enough.

327
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:46,782
He could've suffered a stroke
when he was intubated.

328
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:49,412
Well, blood clots are common
in paralyzed patients.

329
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:52,218
The inactivity causes--
Not interested in why.

330
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:56,021
- Let's get an M.R. angiogram,
check for an embolic stroke.
- He doesn't want you treating him.

331
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:59,996
- They dropped the court order.
- Yeah, and that girl dropped
the charges against Kobe.

332
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:03,125
- Doesn't mean he should call her
and see if she's free to get a sundae.
- Good point.

333
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:05,362
But I can go
within 50 feet of him now.

334
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,501
You need me, you have 'em
page me. Anytime.

335
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:16,445
Okay.

336
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:36,061
- Get out of here.
- Sure. That makes sense.

337
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:38,568
You hate me for saving your life.

338
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:41,697
Well, in fairness to your side,
you were also dying because of me, so--

339
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:44,936
- You knew I didn't want to be saved.
- That's what's interesting.

340
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:48,468
Your thyroid was low,
but not enough to cause depression.

341
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:53,507
So you came here to tell me
that even if I can't walk,
I can still hear the birds sing,

342
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:56,577
enjoy a rainbow,
the feeling of sunshine on my face?

343
00:25:57,989 --> 00:26:00,856
Those things are fun.

344
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:03,759
Okay. Life sucks.

345
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:06,194
Your life sucks more than most.

346
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:10,098
It's not as bad as some,
which is depressing all by itself.

347
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:13,966
But do me a favor.

348
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,837
Just let me find out
what's wrong with you.

349
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:20,537
Then if you still want to kill yourself,

350
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:24,745
I'll give you a hand.

351
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:27,080
- That sound fair?
- Yeah. Sure.

352
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:30,553
I'll stick around
to indulge your obsession.

353
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:34,956
It's over. I lost my air.

354
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:37,017
The session the other night
with those kids--

355
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:41,031
That was a test to see
if I could still play. I can't.

356
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:44,762
And that's all you are, a musician?

357
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:48,135
I got one thing, same as you.

358
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:50,504
Really?

359
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:52,975
Well, apparently you know me
better than I know you.

360
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:55,706
I know that limp.

361
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,873
I know the empty ring finger.

362
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:01,077
And that obsessive
nature of yours--
That's a big secret.

363
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:06,749
You don't risk jail and your career
to save somebody who doesn't
want to be saved...

364
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:11,091
unless you got something--
anything-- one thing.

365
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:17,032
The reason normal people got
wives and kids and hobbies--
whatever--

366
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:19,502
That's because they ain't got
that one thing that--

367
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:22,665
that hits 'em that hard and that true.

368
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:25,403
I got music. You got this--

369
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:30,107
the thing you think about all the time,
thing that keeps you south of normal.

370
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:33,378
Yeah. Makes us great.
Makes us the best.

371
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:35,612
All we miss out on
is everything else.

372
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:41,217
No woman waiting at home after work
with the drink and the kiss.

373
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:44,193
That ain't gonna happen for us.

374
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:46,253
That's why God made microwaves.

375
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,266
Yeah.

376
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,325
But when it's over,

377
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,461
it's over.

378
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:00,838
Yeah.

379
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:20,153
What're you doin'?

380
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:22,165
It's not over for me.

381
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:25,293
Either you're gonna
call the cops again,
or we're doing this.

382
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:29,363
You want to die,
you can do it just as easily
inside an M.R.I. machine.

383
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:41,743
So when I go back to L.A.,
I'm doing the Dana lectures again this year.

384
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,754
Wow.
Thank you.

385
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:46,518
Thanks.
That's quite an honor.
It's all political.

386
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:48,320
Don't be modest. You've earned it.

387
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,486
I got lucky on a couple studies I was doing.

388
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:54,157
It all sells tickets.
You remember last year's
lectures, don't you?

389
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:58,532
- I remember the cigar bar afterwards.
- The only reason to attend the thing--
cigars and pool.

390
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:04,037
You enjoy working with Dr. House?

391
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,744
Not the word I'd use.

392
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:10,337
We work too hard
not to enjoy ourselves, right?

393
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:15,413
- Mmm. You seeing anybody?
- Kinda, sorta.

394
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:19,048
- Serious?
- I don't know. It could be.

395
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:20,887
You think she'd, uh, enjoy L.A.?

396
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,772
Hamilton offered me a job.

397
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:43,814
You gonna take it?
I haven't decided.

398
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:46,578
You already have the most
prestigious fellowship.
It's a partnership--

399
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:52,146
Three times the money,
car allowance, moving expense,
pension plan,

400
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:56,159
the chance to work for a guy
who gives a crap what people think.
Why didn't you just tell him yes?

401
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:59,424
I made
a commitment here.
Right.

402
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:03,661
House would let you out of it in a heartbeat.
Or he wouldn't,
just to jerk me around.

403
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:05,760
Would you guys have taken the job?

404
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:10,035
Don't need the money.
We're not like you.
I don't hate House.

405
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:12,736
You guys really don't have a problem
with him, with what he did?

406
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,802
He knows we disagree
with his choice.

407
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:18,576
Choice? Chase,
it's not apples and oranges.
It's right and wrong.

408
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,312
And he does it like he doesn't care.
He assaults the guy...

409
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:24,253
and moves on to the next
differential diagnosis like it's nothing.

410
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:26,313
What do you want from him?
Hand-wringing? Torment?

411
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:28,586
You want him to cry himself
to sleep at night?
Yeah!

412
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:33,290
Yeah, I want some clue
that he knows it's a big deal.
That it scares him, that it matters.

413
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:36,026
Whoa, whoa. What's that?

414
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:39,260
It was a stroke.

415
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:44,339
- Well done, Cameron.
- House called it.
The arm and legs are unrelated.

416
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:48,311
Oh, you make enough calls,
one of them is bound to be right.

417
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:51,143
Yeah. He's just
a lucky, lucky guy.

418
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:55,380
Listen, listen. I just think
it wouldn't hurt him
to learn a little humility.

419
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,455
So what's the verdict?

420
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:02,459
Embolus. The arm problem
was caused by a clot.

421
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:05,018
There's a good chance we can
bust the clot with T.P.A.

422
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:08,395
Do it. See what happens
to his arm.

423
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,773
We found a blood clot
in your brain.

424
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:24,178
We'd like to start you on heparin.
It's a blood thinner.

425
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:28,743
- What are the side effects?
- Well, your lungs are kind of
chewed up from the pneumonia.

426
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,414
- Good chance there'll be an effusion.
- Bleeding?

427
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:36,051
Into his lungs.
It's our best chance to give you back
the use of your arm.

428
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:37,856
I don't need my arm
without my air.

429
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:41,421
- The damage would likely be minimal.
- No.

430
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:46,028
It's his call.

431
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:49,768
Or we could do an embolectomy.

432
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:51,775
Basically, we go in
and pull the clot out.

433
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:55,779
He's saying no to drugs,
and you're recommending brain surgery?

434
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:57,838
Bypasses the risk to the lungs.

435
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,077
- It'll either help your arm, or--
- Or it'll kill me.

436
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:03,882
From your point of view,
it's a win-win.

437
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:06,253
Okay.

438
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:09,054
We'll set up the procedure
for today.

439
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:23,272
We're in your carotid artery.

440
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:27,209
This is gonna take us
all the way up into your brain.

441
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,439
You all right?

442
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:31,641
Yes.

443
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:41,919
The sludge is blocking the blood flow
to the part of the brain that controls your arm.

444
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:54,367
All done. You still okay?

445
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,674
I think so.

446
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:00,734
I don't know. I guess...

447
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:04,441
it's just with Dr. Hamilton here,
I-I noticed a difference in styles.

448
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:08,849
His style involves humility?

449
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,184
Another difference in our styles--

450
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:14,315
I don't care much for apologies.
You can go.

451
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:16,826
I didn't know you were standing there
when I said that, okay?

452
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:19,920
It was completely rude.
Do you mean genuine humility,

453
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,592
you know, with all the self-doubt
and the self-questioning,

454
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:26,535
or Hamilton's polite, patronizing,
"Aw, shucks" humility?

455
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:28,595
You're both excellent doctors.
Thank you.

456
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:32,939
And humility is an important quality,
especially if you're wrong a lot.

457
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,979
You've been wrong
every step of the way.

458
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:45,220
'Course, when you're right,
self-doubt doesn't help anybody, does it?

459
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:53,021
We gotta go.

460
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:03,840
Congratulations, Greg.

461
00:34:03,908 --> 00:34:06,172
Congratulations. Why, Marty?

462
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:08,405
John woke up.
He can use his arm.

463
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:10,572
Thank you.

464
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:13,173
Now, look, I know
we've had our differences,

465
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:16,414
but I think when a person
does something well,
it ought to be recognized.

466
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:18,421
The phone works.

467
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:22,391
Next time you want to make me feel
all warm and fuzzy, leave a message.

468
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,894
Don't get me wrong.
I'm overcome with joy.

469
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:26,589
- Doc.
- Yeah.

470
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:30,100
- What?
- You just touched my leg.

471
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:32,602
What, are you gonna charge me
with assault again?

472
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:35,537
No.

473
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:38,200
I felt it.

474
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:49,114
He now has feeling
all the way up to the calf.

475
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:51,587
This is the way medicine evolved.

476
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:53,647
Patients sometimes get better.

477
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:56,887
You have no idea why,
but unless you give a reason,
they won't pay you.

478
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:59,020
Anybody notice
if there's a full moon?

479
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,156
You're saying he just
spontaneously got better?

480
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:03,826
No. I'm saying, let's rule out
the lunar god and go from there.

481
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:05,835
Something he's on is working.

482
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:09,066
The enzyme replacement protocol
is working, reversing the A.L.S.

483
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,301
The timing doesn't seem
suspicious to you?

484
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:14,833
Do you think Dr. House'll see it that way,
figure it's his medication doin' the job?

485
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:17,073
I'm sure he will.

486
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:20,208
It's one of ours.
How do we figure out
which drug is doing the trick?

487
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,343
Easy. We just stop all of them.

488
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:25,321
- One of those drugs is helping him.
- And the rest--

489
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:29,291
steroids, antibiotics, anti-inflammatories--
They're toxic, if we leave him on all of them.

490
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,624
- He'll walk again.
- Yeah. To his own funeral.

491
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:34,290
But if we stop everything,
he'll get worse.
True.

492
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:37,664
We'll add our medications back
one at a time. When he gets better,
we'll have our answer.

493
00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:41,398
- And if he doesn't get better?
- Then we're in trouble.

494
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,963
Not as much as he is.

495
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:46,100
But I suppose that was your point.

496
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:53,212
I assume you want me to convince
Hamilton to stop his treatments too.
Don't care.

497
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:56,014
At least five of the medications
are a part of his protocol.

498
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:58,817
If his stuff was helping,
the guy would be
playing tennis months ago.

499
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:01,222
It's our round of treatment
that's helping.

500
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:04,386
Right.
So that's what you'll stop.

501
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:06,953
It shouldn't be
more than 15 or 20 minutes.

502
00:36:07,031 --> 00:36:10,865
So your philosophy is,
if they don't want treatment,
they get it shoved down their throat,

503
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:14,735
- but if it might cure their paralysis,
whoa, we better slow down.
- Yeah.

504
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:17,797
Yes, Doctor, I love it.
My old philosophy used to be
live and let live.

505
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:22,642
But I'm taking this needlepoint class,
and they gave us these really big pillows.

506
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:25,910
- What's your philosophy
on employee relations?
- That's a very tiny pillow.

507
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:28,713
Great. It sounds like
you know what you're doing.

508
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:31,346
Greg.

509
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:34,152
- Can I have a word?
- Can it wait for the commercial, Marty?

510
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:36,989
Say hi to my friend Jimmy.

511
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:40,691
Pleasure.

512
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:42,756
Your diagnostic trial--

513
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:45,063
Seriously, commercial's
in about five minutes.

514
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:48,071
- That's a dangerous game.
- Only if we're watching in the bathtub.

515
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:52,269
I need to know exactly
what medications you were
giving John Henry.

516
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:55,403
Forget it. And if Foreman tells you
what John Henry used to be on--

517
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:57,913
- You're gonna fire him?
- Nope.

518
00:36:57,982 --> 00:37:00,576
I'll make him live out every day
of his two-year contract.

519
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:02,619
- Foreman asked to leave?
- Not yet.

520
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:06,384
- But how do you know I made him--
- You're a polite twit, but you're not an idiot.

521
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:10,655
I need to know what medications
you've taken him off of.

522
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:16,523
Wait a second.
You're not an idiot.

523
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:22,235
You need to know
what medications I've stopped...

524
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:24,240
because--

525
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,902
He's getting worse.

526
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:35,816
Right now you still
work for me. Come on.

527
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:40,480
No feeling. No wiggling.

528
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:44,050
Bad news is John Henry's
back where he started.
Good news is Hamilton looks bad.

529
00:37:44,128 --> 00:37:47,461
Yeah, it's not whether you win or lose.
It's whether the other guy loses.

530
00:37:47,531 --> 00:37:50,022
What was the first thing
we put him on?
Steroids, for the pneumonia.

531
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,763
Well, put him back on them.
Give him 24 hours. See what happens.

532
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:55,829
His lungs aren't great.
They might cause
another respiratory collapse.

533
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:57,965
Sure hope not.
I didn't much like that lawyer.

534
00:37:58,042 --> 00:38:00,442
And get an M.R.I.
He already got one, and an M.R.A.

535
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:02,911
Well, obviously something is
different now. Do it again.

536
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:05,972
Chase, take care of the scan.
Cameron, put him on the steroids.

537
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,944
We should probably talk, huh?

538
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:19,354
Thin cuts.
What levels?

539
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:22,365
T-9 through the cauda equina,
same as the last time.

540
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:27,269
You really think House would let
Foreman out of his contract?
He has to.

541
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:31,035
If he doesn't, he's telling Foreman
he needs him. House can't handle that.

542
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:40,283
Oh, my God.

543
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:46,446
I checked him out.

544
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:50,754
He's a great doctor.

545
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:54,559
- You think he's better than I am?
- This about your ego?

546
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:56,827
Answer the question.

547
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:03,005
It's not gonna change
how I think about myself.
Might affect my opinion of you,

548
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:05,838
but that shouldn't affect
your opinion of yourself.

549
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:08,076
Now I'm getting confused.

550
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:11,774
If you think he's a better doctor
than I am, then you should take the job.

551
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:17,151
Otherwise, you should get him
to buy you two or three more
nostalgic lunches and then politely decline.

552
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:20,418
It's that simple? I should just
ignore the mockery and abuse?

553
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:23,619
- Oh, how do I abuse you?
- How do you not?

554
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:26,424
- If I make a mistake--
- I hold you accountable. So what?

555
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:31,230
- Dr. Hamilton forgives.
He's capable of moving on.
- That is not what he does.

556
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:34,328
I screwed up his case. He told me--
He never said you were forgiven.

557
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:36,339
I was there.
He said it wasn't your fault.

558
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:38,534
- So?
- So, it was.

559
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:41,442
You took a chance.
You did something great.

560
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:45,073
You were wrong, but it was still great.
You should feel great that it was great.

561
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:49,017
You should feel like crap that it was wrong.
That's the difference between him and me.

562
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:51,646
He thinks you do your job,
and what will be will be.

563
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,883
I think that what I do
and what you do matters.

564
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,958
He sleeps better at night.
He shouldn't.

565
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:05,466
- Arteriovenous malformation.
- Intradural. Compressing his spine.

566
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:09,639
Causing his paralysis.

567
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:12,437
How could Hamilton
have missed an A.V.M.?

568
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,444
Well, we missed it too,

569
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:16,639
'cause it wasn't there before.

570
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:18,705
Are you saying
it just grew overnight?

571
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:20,717
No.

572
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:24,551
It was on the spine.
It wasn't on the M.R.I.

573
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:28,718
- Same anatomic location.
- It's not there.

574
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:31,990
- Well, what is there?
- Nothing.

575
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:35,225
Or something that looks like nothing.

576
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:40,328
Background noise. Static.
- Scar tissue? Inflammation?

577
00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:43,134
If it's inflammation, the steroids
would've shrunk it down.

578
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,433
Revealing the A.V.M.,

579
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:49,104
which has always been there,
hiding behind its own swelling.

580
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,943
We remove that, he'll walk again.

581
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:42,131
Dr. House.

582
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,335
Cora's meeting me outside
with the limo.

583
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:50,000
I'm bein' discharged.

584
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:52,235
Fifty bucks says
I can beat you to the curb.

585
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:56,143
Thanks for stickin' with the case.

586
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:59,148
I can't do anything else.

587
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:02,648
You're much more easily amused
when you can walk.

588
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,779
How bizarre.

589
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:07,187
I'm guessing that you weren't
exactly Mr. Sunshine...

590
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:09,920
even before your leg got messed up.

591
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:15,164
I want you to have this.

592
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:26,876
Wow.

593
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:30,209
You can sell it if you want to.
Just promise me you won't play it.

594
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,718
How many of those pills you takin'?

595
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:41,754
I'm in pain.

596
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:44,817
Yes.

597
00:42:46,363 --> 00:42:48,422
Aren't we all?

598
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:53,000
So, uh, where do you buy these things?
Do they have cane stores?

599
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:56,471
Ah, don't worry about it.
You'll be jogging before
you need a second one.

600
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,633
See you tomorrow, Eric.
