Doc, Help, Doc!

3
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,400
It Stopped Bleeding

4
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,500
That's Because Your Blood's
Freezing As It's Hitting The Air.

5
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,700
Here, Apply Pressureon It.

6
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,000
I Think My Legis Frozen.

7
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,800
That's The Leastof Your Problems.

8
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,900
The Blade Severedyour Femoral Artery.

9
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,400
Am I Gonna Lose My Leg?

10
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,000
Frostbite's Not Too Bad
But I Gotta Fix your Artery Now.

11
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,500
This Is Gonna Hurt.

12
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,700
You're Gonna Put That In Me?

13
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,200
Glue's The Best Wayto Repair
Your Artery At This Temperature.

14
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,100
It Looks Okay.

15
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,700
Here, Tear Offsome Pieces.
I Have To Check Your Foot.

16
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,400
Blood Flow Looks Good.

17
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,700
Your Leg Should Be Okay.

18
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,800
I Thought I Was Done.

19
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,200
Yeah, Like I'd Let Anything Happen To You.

20
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,100
You're The Only One
Who Can Fix The Generators.

21
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,200
One...Two...Three.

22
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,700
Cate, Cate, Are You Okay?

23
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,200
Are You Okay?

24
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,700
I--I--I Need Help.

25
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,800

New Case.Psych Department
Asked For You Personally.

31
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,800
Patient's A Crazy Person?

32
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,200
You're A Crazy Person.

33
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,600
Patient's A Psychiatrist.

34
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,600
There's Something Wrong With Coma Guy's Cable.

35
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,100
He Seems Fine With It.

36
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,300
Your Patient Is An Adjunct
Faculty Member Here But Currently--

37
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,700
The Budget Committee Voted To
Charge For Cable In The Patient Rooms.

38
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,600
Slippery Slope.

39
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,700
Today We With Hold Porn,
Tomorrow It's Clean Bandages.

40
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,100
Talk To Carlson In Derm--

41
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,500
He Runs The Budget Committee--

42
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,200
After You Look At This.

43
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,300
After You Talk To Carlson,

44
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,200
-Maybe I'll--
-The Patient Is Trapped At The South Pole.

45
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,300
Any Possibility Of Evacuating Her?

46
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,700
That Wouldn't Be Any Fun.

47
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,500
And For The Next Two Months,

48
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,600
Winds Make It Impossible
To Fly Anything In Or Out.

49
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,500
Could Be Appendicitis Or A Gallstone.

50
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,800
Or A Kidney Stone.

51
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,700
That Wouldn't Be Any Fun.

52
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,500
If It's Appendicitis Down There,

53
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,100
Her Appendix Ruptures,She Dies,

54
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,100
There's Nothing We Can Do.

55
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,400
If It's Stones,She Takes Pain Meds,

56
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,300
The Stone Passes,
There's Nothing We Need To Do.

57
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,800
Could Be A Struvite Kidney Stone.

58
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,400
Most Kidney Stones Are Calcium And Benign.

59
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,100
Why Would You Suspect A Struvite Stone?

60
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,200
'Cause He Said Kidney Stones Were Boring.

61
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,500
It's Possible.

62
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,000
She's On Birth Control.

63
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,600
Lots Of Sex Could Lead
To Urinary Tract Infection,

64
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,400
Which Could Lead To An
Infection-Laced Struvite Kidney Stone.

65
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,300
Excessive Antarctic Drilling.

66
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,200
Bad For The Environment And The Ladies.

67
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,100
If It's A Struvite Stone

68
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,100
She Needs To Break It Up Quickly
Before The Infection Shuts Down Her Kidneys.

69
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,700
This Is Where It Gets Fun.

70
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,200
These Are The Supplies And
Medications She Has Available.

71
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,600
Nothing Here That Can Break Up A Kidney Stone.

72
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,400
What Else Do They Have Down There?

73
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,800
I Just Said--

74
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,900
I Don't Mean Medical Stuff.
Other Stuff.

75
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,400
Some Geological Equipment Breaks Ice
And Rock The Same Way We Break Kidney Stones.

76
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,800
Uh, Discovery Channel.

77
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,600
I Like Watching Them Blow Stuff Up.

78
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,800
Who Doesn't?

79
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,900
That Reminds Me.

80
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,900
Coma Guy Needs Cable.

81
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,200
Women's Billiard Is The Only
Thing That's Keeping Him Alive.

82
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,200
I'm Sure Carlson Will Be Moved By His Plight.

83
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,000
Carlson Won't Listen To
Me Since I Hit On His Wife.

84
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,900
You Knew!

85
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,900
God No, I Thought I Was Hitting On His Daughter.

86
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,400
Look, You're On The Committee.
He'll Listen To You.

87
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,900
I'm An Avid Reader Of "Committees
With Hotties" Message Boards.

88
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,800
I'm Not Oxicillin,500 Milligrams I.V.

89
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,800
Studies Conducted In Major Hospitals

90
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,000
Indicate That Happy Patients Recover Faster.

91
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,400
Studies Conducted In My Apartment
Show That Tv Makes People Happy.

92
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,200
Premium Channels Have A Particularly Striking Effect.

93
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,500
Charging Patients For Cable
Is Bringing In 13 Grand A Month.

94
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,800
Until This Injustice Is Righted,

95
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,700
I Am Going To Waste 13 Grand A Day.

96
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,200
It's $2.49 Down.

97
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,100
Get An Ekg And A Cardiac Enzyme.

98
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,300
If Those Check Out,Discharge Him
And Tell Him To Get A Snow Blower.

99
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,000
How Much Is 13 Grand Divided By $.04?

100
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,000
I Am Not Giving You Cable.

101
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,400
You're Gonna Have To Somehow Survive
With The Broadcast Networks Alone.

102
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,500
I'll Be Fine On Tuesdays.

103
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,600
If Sound Waves From The Flaw Detector Break The Egg,

104
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,700
It Should Safely Dissolve Your Kidney Stone.

105
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,400
This Isn't Going To Work.

106
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,800
There's No Reason It Shouldn't.

107
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,100
Sound Waves Are Sound Waves.

108
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:11,900
Stones Are Stones.

109
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,600
Some Are Bigger Than Others.

110
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,100
Some Are Inside Me.

111
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,700
How's It Going,Team Macgyver?

112
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,700
Oh, Great.

113
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,900
I Can't Get Cable,
But I Can Get The South Poleon Hi-Def.

114
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,100
We're Almost Readyto Start The Test.

115
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,900
Test?

116
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,800
Did Ford Test The Edsel?

117
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,000
Did Coke Test New Coke?

118
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,700
Did Shakespeare Test His Final Play: Snow Dogs?

119
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,900
I'm Guessing You're Doctor House?

120
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,800
I Was Wonderingwhen You Might Drop By.

121
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,300
Could She See Me?

122
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,200
Oh, Yeah.

123
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,400
Think Jagger Shows Up For The Sound Check?

124
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,600
Okay--Roadies,Off The Stage.

125
00:07:51,796 --> 00:07:53,230
Go Help Cameron In The E.R.

126
00:07:53,231 --> 00:07:54,058
Why?

127
00:07:54,059 --> 00:07:55,721
No Way You're Just
Doing Her A Favor.

128
00:07:55,722 --> 00:07:57,618
E.R. Is Standing Room Only.

129
00:07:57,653 --> 00:07:59,370
Which Means Cameron's Bound
To Make A Mistake.

130
00:07:59,371 --> 00:08:01,645
Find It
So I Can Blackmail Her.

131
00:08:02,317 --> 00:08:03,245
<I>As Far As You Know,</I>

132
00:08:03,246 --> 00:08:04,958
This Is Way More Than Just

133
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:07,207
Some Silly Battle
Over Cable.

134
00:08:13,089 --> 00:08:14,401
<I>Ready.</I>

135
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:40,504
You-You Might Wanna

136
00:08:40,505 --> 00:08:42,659
Just Dial It Down A Smidge.

137
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:45,739
<I>I Am Not Doing This.</I>

138
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,071
Your Kidney Stone Theory
Hinges On Me Having Sex, But-

139
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:50,932
<I>Let Me Guess.</I>

140
00:08:50,933 --> 00:08:52,638
<I>You're As Pure
As The Driven Snow.</I>

141
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:54,858
Only If The Snow
Likes To Be On Top.

142
00:08:55,447 --> 00:08:57,899
<I>But I Am Here
Doing Psychological Research.</I>

143
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,043
Generally Not A Good Idea

144
00:08:59,044 --> 00:09:00,965
To Swap Fluids
With Your Subjects.

145
00:09:00,966 --> 00:09:04,341
Struvite Stones Are Possible
In People Who Don't Have Sex.

146
00:09:04,342 --> 00:09:06,540
They're Certainly Possible
In People Who Claim-

147
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,962
I've Had No U.T.I.S.

148
00:09:08,963 --> 00:09:10,243
No Pain On Urination.

149
00:09:10,244 --> 00:09:12,885
You Do Realize That Only One
Of Us Is A Real Doctor.

150
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,114
You Do Realize Only One Of Us

151
00:09:14,115 --> 00:09:16,268
Has Any Control Over My Actions.

152
00:09:19,265 --> 00:09:21,689
Dr. Milton, Are You Able
To Run A Chem 7?

153
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:22,517
Yes.

154
00:09:22,518 --> 00:09:24,766
That'll Tell Us If Her Kidney
Function's Declining.

155
00:09:24,767 --> 00:09:26,420
If It Is, He's Right.

156
00:09:26,421 --> 00:09:28,504
<I>Struvite Stone's
Most Likely Explanation.</I>

157
00:09:28,505 --> 00:09:30,302
If Not, She's Right.

158
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,220
Sorry, I Know How You Like
To Avoid

159
00:09:37,221 --> 00:09:38,388
Avoiding Confrontation.

160
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:39,739
While We're Waiting
For That Test

161
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,503
To Prove Me Right,

162
00:09:40,504 --> 00:09:42,555
Start I.V. Cefuroxime.

163
00:09:42,584 --> 00:09:43,974
Keep The Infection In The Stone

164
00:09:43,975 --> 00:09:45,272
From Wiping Out Your Kidneys.

165
00:09:45,273 --> 00:09:47,983
I'll Send The Chem 7 Results
When I'm Done.

166
00:09:52,877 --> 00:09:54,422
She's
A Great Psychiatrist.

167
00:09:54,423 --> 00:09:56,509
One Session,
I've Got Shrinkage.

168
00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:00,183
House Wants Us To Spy On You,
Report Back.

169
00:10:01,491 --> 00:10:03,259
And You're Telling Me This
Because...

170
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,500
We Don't Want To Do It.

171
00:10:04,941 --> 00:10:06,163
I Don't See A Problem
So Far.

172
00:10:06,164 --> 00:10:07,999
If Our Choice Is
Between Pissing House Off

173
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,184
Or Pissing You Off,

174
00:10:09,185 --> 00:10:10,851
That's Not Much Of A Choice.

175
00:10:10,852 --> 00:10:13,564
So Unless I Give House Cable,

176
00:10:13,565 --> 00:10:15,108
You're Gonna Make My Life
Miserable.

177
00:10:15,109 --> 00:10:16,332
Yes.

178
00:10:16,873 --> 00:10:18,020
And You're Telling Me This

179
00:10:18,021 --> 00:10:20,098
So You Won't Feel As Guilty
When You Do It.

180
00:10:21,969 --> 00:10:23,216
Yes.

181
00:10:23,217 --> 00:10:26,211
Accommodating House's Every Whim
Is Not My Job Anymore.

182
00:10:26,212 --> 00:10:28,754
But It Is Ours.

183
00:10:28,755 --> 00:10:31,497
House Will Get
What He Wants.

184
00:10:37,034 --> 00:10:39,123
Maybe We Should Just Pay
For It Ourselves

185
00:10:39,214 --> 00:10:40,819
And Tell Him She Folded.

186
00:10:41,532 --> 00:10:42,647
No.

187
00:10:44,732 --> 00:10:46,427
Your Chem 7 Results

188
00:10:46,428 --> 00:10:48,978
Show That Your Kidney Function
Is Declining.

189
00:10:49,228 --> 00:10:50,716
Sounds Like A Kidney Stone
To Me.

190
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:53,894
The Decreased Function
Could Be From Dehydration

191
00:10:53,895 --> 00:10:56,250
Caused By Vomiting
Due To A Gallstone.

192
00:10:56,251 --> 00:10:58,435
You Agreed That The Chem 7
Would Decide

193
00:10:58,436 --> 00:10:59,744
If It Was A Struvite Stone.

194
00:10:59,745 --> 00:11:01,085
I Agreed To Do The Test.

195
00:11:01,086 --> 00:11:03,419
The Results Are Up
For Interpretation.

196
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,062
I'll Redo The Test
In An Hour When I'm Rehydrated.

197
00:11:06,063 --> 00:11:07,392
Have You Noticed
Any Improvement

198
00:11:07,393 --> 00:11:09,164
Since Starting The Cefuroxime?

199
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:10,995
Not Really.
The Pain's About The Same.

200
00:11:10,996 --> 00:11:11,967
While You're Waiting,

201
00:11:11,968 --> 00:11:13,840
We Should Run Another Test
With The Geology Equipment.

202
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:15,827
You're Not Taking
The Cefuroxime.

203
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,317
<I>She's Right Handed.</I>

204
00:11:17,976 --> 00:11:20,595
<I>Means She Would've Put
The I.V. In Her Left Arm.</I>

205
00:11:20,675 --> 00:11:22,125
Catheter In The Arm
Makes It Hard

206
00:11:22,126 --> 00:11:24,138
To Bend The Elbow The Way
People Do When They Drink!

207
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:26,151
We Have A Limited Supply
Of Medication

208
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:27,817
And I'm Not About To Waste It.

209
00:11:27,818 --> 00:11:29,992
Last I Checked, You Had
A Limited Supply Of Doctors.

210
00:11:29,993 --> 00:11:31,840
Right Before I Got Sick,

211
00:11:31,841 --> 00:11:34,660
One Of My Crew Members
Severed His Femoral Artery.

212
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:36,153
He Needs The Cefuroxime.

213
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:37,553
Right, He Called Dibs.

214
00:11:37,554 --> 00:11:39,780
His Need Is Definitive.

215
00:11:39,781 --> 00:11:41,682
<I>Mine Is Speculative.</I>

216
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,031
You're Breathing Fast.

217
00:11:44,122 --> 00:11:45,468
It's Because I'm Pissed Off!

218
00:11:45,469 --> 00:11:48,253
Lift Up Your Chin.
Show Me Your Windpipe.

219
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:53,064
Ah!
My Chest Hurts.

220
00:11:53,065 --> 00:11:54,475
It's Deviating To The Left.

221
00:11:54,476 --> 00:11:55,844
Means Her Right Lung
Is Collapsing.

222
00:11:55,845 --> 00:11:57,365
Cate, Is Anyone There With You?

223
00:11:57,366 --> 00:11:58,578
Sean Went To The Mess.

224
00:11:58,579 --> 00:12:00,041
You Need To Call Someone-
There's No Time.

225
00:12:00,042 --> 00:12:01,412
Get A Syringe And A Needle.

226
00:12:01,413 --> 00:12:03,185
Why Am I Doing-
Shut Up And Look.

227
00:12:05,206 --> 00:12:06,606
She Could Pass Out.
She Needs-

228
00:12:06,607 --> 00:12:08,447
She Needs To Reinflate
That Lung

229
00:12:08,989 --> 00:12:10,874
Okay, Now Pull Out
The Plunger.

230
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,701
I Want You To Stab Yourself
In Your Right Side

231
00:12:12,702 --> 00:12:14,151
Between The Second
And Third Rib

232
00:12:14,152 --> 00:12:16,517
In The Mid-Clavicular Line.

233
00:12:18,391 --> 00:12:19,908
By The Time We Get
Someone Else There,

234
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:21,237
You'll Have Suffocated.

235
00:12:21,238 --> 00:12:22,834
Just Do It.

236
00:12:34,672 --> 00:12:35,728
See All The Good Stuff
That Happens

237
00:12:35,729 --> 00:12:37,273
When You Listen To Me?

238
00:12:39,613 --> 00:12:41,741
Means It's Not
A Kidney Stone.

239
00:12:51,615 --> 00:12:53,652
<I>Right Side Pain,
Vomiting,</I>

240
00:12:53,653 --> 00:12:55,970
<I>And Now A Lung
That Gets Traumatized</I>

241
00:12:55,971 --> 00:12:57,104
<I>Without Any Trauma.</I>

242
00:12:57,105 --> 00:12:58,015
<I>Sounds Odd.</I>

243
00:12:58,016 --> 00:12:58,956
<I>Probably Is Odd.</I>

244
00:12:58,957 --> 00:13:00,690
We Should Discuss This,
Then Call Her Back.

245
00:13:00,691 --> 00:13:01,519
Oh, That's Fine.

246
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,339
I Made Sure We Got

247
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,416
The South Pole
Long Distance Plan.

248
00:13:04,933 --> 00:13:07,018
Your Latest Kidney Function
Test Shows-

249
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:07,984
<I>I Know What It Shows.</I>

250
00:13:07,985 --> 00:13:08,871
I Ran It.

251
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:10,151
<I>The More You Interrupt,</I>

252
00:13:10,152 --> 00:13:11,928
The Longer My Grandstanding
Is Gonna Take.

253
00:13:11,929 --> 00:13:13,205
Since When Do You Let Patients

254
00:13:13,206 --> 00:13:14,515
Participate In Differentials?

255
00:13:14,516 --> 00:13:15,843
Since The Patient
And Her Doctor

256
00:13:15,844 --> 00:13:17,264
Happen To Be The Same Person.

257
00:13:17,265 --> 00:13:19,352
Your Kidney Function
Is Still Declining.

258
00:13:19,353 --> 00:13:20,719
Means You Have
A Kidney Problem.

259
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,782
But Not One That Needed
Antibiotics.

260
00:13:22,783 --> 00:13:24,207
Makes Us Equally Wrong.

261
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:26,447
<I>No, Makes Us Both Wrong.</I>

262
00:13:26,448 --> 00:13:27,601
Not Equally.

263
00:13:27,602 --> 00:13:29,628
You Were At Least Six Wronger.

264
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:32,132
<I>They Run A Ppd
Before You Shipped Out?</I>

265
00:13:32,133 --> 00:13:34,294
On Me And Everybody Else Here.
It's Not T.B.

266
00:13:34,295 --> 00:13:35,935
Excuse Us A Second.

267
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,157
<I>Cancer Explains The Symptoms.</I>

268
00:13:39,158 --> 00:13:40,844
A Tumor In Her Lung
Or Kidney

269
00:13:40,845 --> 00:13:42,392
That Threw A Clot
To The Other Organ.

270
00:13:42,393 --> 00:13:44,791
And You're Worried
The Tumor Might Overhear,

271
00:13:44,792 --> 00:13:46,110
Realize We're On To It.

272
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,865
Cancer's A Hard Diagnosis
For Patients

273
00:13:47,866 --> 00:13:49,367
<I>Even When They're Not
In The South Pole.</I>

274
00:13:49,368 --> 00:13:50,480
We Should Figure This Out,

275
00:13:50,481 --> 00:13:51,987
Maybe Bring Wilson In.

276
00:13:57,533 --> 00:13:59,602
Obviously You Two
Think I'm In Bad Shape.

277
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:00,967
Only If You Count The Tumor.

278
00:14:00,968 --> 00:14:01,801
House!

279
00:14:01,802 --> 00:14:03,472
Probably In Your Abdomen.

280
00:14:04,114 --> 00:14:04,836
<I>But You Don't Have</I>

281
00:14:04,837 --> 00:14:05,874
<I>Any Advanced
Imaging Equipment.</I>

282
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:08,254
<I>You Also Don't Have
A Surgeon To Biopsy It,</I>

283
00:14:08,255 --> 00:14:09,931
<I>Any Stains To Use
On The Slide,</I>

284
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,729
<I>Or An Oncologist
To Analyze It.</I>

285
00:14:12,542 --> 00:14:14,365
Too Far Away
To Hold Her Hand.

286
00:14:15,069 --> 00:14:16,688
I Have Cancer?

287
00:14:16,876 --> 00:14:17,888
Possibly.

288
00:14:17,889 --> 00:14:19,708
Since The Only
Imaging Equipment

289
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:22,106
You Have Is X-Ray,
Let's Start There.

290
00:14:22,324 --> 00:14:24,239
X- Ray Your Entire Body.

291
00:14:24,736 --> 00:14:26,693
I'll Upload The Images
When I'm Done.

292
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,314
Good For You.

293
00:14:59,536 --> 00:15:01,076
She's Annoying.

294
00:15:01,532 --> 00:15:03,116
Refused To Take The Antibiotics

295
00:15:03,117 --> 00:15:04,887
Because Other People
Might Need Them.

296
00:15:04,888 --> 00:15:07,783
She Said She Cares
About Other People?

297
00:15:07,894 --> 00:15:09,404
What A Poser.

298
00:15:09,615 --> 00:15:11,004
K.U.B. Is Clean.

299
00:15:11,005 --> 00:15:14,423
You Don't Like Her
Because She's A Psychiatrist.

300
00:15:14,424 --> 00:15:16,191
I'm A Complicated Man.

301
00:15:16,192 --> 00:15:17,671
I Loathe Her For Many Reasons.

302
00:15:17,672 --> 00:15:19,910
Never Before Has A Profession
Been So Decried

303
00:15:19,911 --> 00:15:21,889
By Someone Who Needed It
So Badly.

304
00:15:21,908 --> 00:15:24,785
You Talk A Lot Of Smack
About Tranny Hookers.

305
00:15:25,171 --> 00:15:26,795
Enlarged Mediastinal Node.

306
00:15:26,796 --> 00:15:27,674
Lymphoma.

307
00:15:27,675 --> 00:15:29,114
Probably,
But We Can't Confirm It

308
00:15:29,115 --> 00:15:30,135
<I>Without A Biopsy.</I>

309
00:15:30,136 --> 00:15:32,256
You Can't Analyze A Biopsy
Without A Stain.

310
00:15:32,257 --> 00:15:33,319
We Can't Biopsy.

311
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,044
'Cause They Don't Have Stains
Down There.

312
00:15:35,045 --> 00:15:36,148
We Need A Substitute.

313
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:37,583
She Can't Biopsy That Node

314
00:15:37,584 --> 00:15:39,453
Without A Surgical Team
And An O.R.

315
00:15:39,454 --> 00:15:42,708
Anything With A Strong Color
Could Work As A Stain.

316
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,412
Printer Ink, Food Coloring,
Coffee.

317
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:47,419
No Thanks.

318
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,331
??? One She Can Biopsy.

319
00:15:50,725 --> 00:15:51,961
That Makes Sense.

320
00:15:51,962 --> 00:15:53,022
That Makes Sense?

321
00:15:53,023 --> 00:15:54,231
I Said It First.

322
00:15:54,232 --> 00:15:56,753
In A Shockingly Calm Manner

323
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:00,427
<I>After I'd Just Been Jerking You
Around For 30 Seconds</I>

324
00:16:00,428 --> 00:16:03,336
Without You Complaining
Or Analyzing Said Jerking.

325
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,738
I Was Being Mature.

326
00:16:05,276 --> 00:16:06,992
In A Lavender Shirt.

327
00:16:07,303 --> 00:16:09,819
You For Some Reason Are Happy.

328
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,563
How Dare You?

329
00:16:11,569 --> 00:16:14,004
The X-Rays Don't Show
Any Other Abnormal Nodes.

330
00:16:14,005 --> 00:16:15,773
Abnormal Nodes
Can Be Felt

331
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:18,056
Before They Can Be Seen
On An X-Ray.

332
00:16:18,475 --> 00:16:20,403
<I>You're Wearing That Shirt
For Someone.</I>

333
00:16:20,404 --> 00:16:21,346
The Health Department.

334
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:22,905
They Frown
On Topless Oncology.

335
00:16:22,906 --> 00:16:24,226
You're Gonna Do A Physical?

336
00:16:24,227 --> 00:16:25,513
Have To.

337
00:16:25,514 --> 00:16:26,826
You And Foreman
Are Gonna Be Here

338
00:16:26,827 --> 00:16:28,289
Looking For A Stain.

339
00:16:31,219 --> 00:16:32,219
I Can Do The Physical.

340
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,491
There's No Reason To Watch.

341
00:16:34,492 --> 00:16:36,858
I Can Think Of At Least
Three Reasons.

342
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,966
One Of Them's Medical.

343
00:16:37,967 --> 00:16:39,046
Where Are You?

344
00:16:39,047 --> 00:16:40,202
<I>Not In Your Office.</I>

345
00:16:40,203 --> 00:16:41,215
You're Not In The Hospital.

346
00:16:41,216 --> 00:16:42,328
No Reason For Me To Be.

347
00:16:42,329 --> 00:16:45,462
I Am Not Undressing For You
In Your Apartment.

348
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:47,163
<I>You're Not In My Apartment.</I>

349
00:16:47,164 --> 00:16:50,261
You're Three Quarters
Of A World Away.

350
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:51,806
I Promise Not To Get Fresh.

351
00:16:51,807 --> 00:16:53,818
I'm Not Taking Off
My Clothes.

352
00:16:54,171 --> 00:16:55,860
One Of Us Has To.

353
00:17:00,461 --> 00:17:01,897
Show Me Your Place.

354
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:07,241
Uh, It's Got Walls,
A Floor,

355
00:17:07,242 --> 00:17:08,744
And In Some Places, A Roof.

356
00:17:08,745 --> 00:17:11,938
I Am Not Exposing Myself
Without Some Reciprocity.

357
00:17:12,021 --> 00:17:14,363
It's My Apartment.
It's Not My Soul.

358
00:17:19,275 --> 00:17:20,898
Living Room.

359
00:17:21,594 --> 00:17:23,112
Slow Down.

360
00:17:23,736 --> 00:17:26,080
<I>Huh, Lots Of Books.</I>

361
00:17:26,081 --> 00:17:27,902
I'm Betting All Medical.

362
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,358
Only If You Count
Jenna Jameson's Autobiography

363
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:31,761
As A Gynecological Text.

364
00:17:31,762 --> 00:17:33,682
Fiction Is A Waste Of Time

365
00:17:33,683 --> 00:17:35,332
Unless You Can Laugh At It.

366
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,650
I Love To Laugh.

367
00:17:36,651 --> 00:17:37,964
Moving On.

368
00:17:39,981 --> 00:17:41,528
Back Up.

369
00:17:42,557 --> 00:17:44,277
How Bad Is The Insomnia?

370
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:46,393
<I>Let Me Clarify That.</I>

371
00:17:46,397 --> 00:17:48,737
Do You Drink Two
Or Three Scotches

372
00:17:48,738 --> 00:17:51,061
Before Passing Out
In Front Of The Tv?

373
00:17:51,766 --> 00:17:53,749
You Are So Far Off.

374
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,386
It's Bourbon.

375
00:17:57,161 --> 00:17:58,851
<I>No Photos Anywhere.</I>

376
00:17:59,021 --> 00:18:00,918
Family And Friends
Aren't Important?

377
00:18:01,764 --> 00:18:02,996
Well, You're Sick.

378
00:18:02,997 --> 00:18:04,444
You Got 20 People
Down The Hall

379
00:18:04,445 --> 00:18:06,174
And You've Had
Exactly One Visitor.

380
00:18:06,175 --> 00:18:07,502
I Don't Want To Panic Anyone.

381
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,221
You Don't Like People.

382
00:18:09,454 --> 00:18:11,368
You Hide On That Ice Cube
So People-

383
00:18:11,369 --> 00:18:12,688
Stop Projecting.

384
00:18:12,689 --> 00:18:14,254
You're Anti-Social,

385
00:18:14,255 --> 00:18:16,778
<I>So You Assume I'm Anti-Social.</I>

386
00:18:16,779 --> 00:18:19,339
How About If I Just Get Naked
And You Shut Up?

387
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,723
If I Thought I Could
Get You Naked,

388
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:22,422
I Would've Led With That.

389
00:18:23,063 --> 00:18:23,939
<I>You'd Rather Show Me</I>

390
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,750
Your Soul Than Your Leg.

391
00:18:27,027 --> 00:18:30,240
Great, You Got Me
All Figured Out.

392
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,620
You Gonna Try And Fix Me Now?

393
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,743
I Never Said
You Needed Fixing.

394
00:18:37,857 --> 00:18:40,313
He's Letting Her Take Part
In The Differentials.

395
00:18:40,472 --> 00:18:42,764
Of Course He Is.
He Likes Her.

396
00:18:43,069 --> 00:18:45,121
Big Shock, Spaghetti Sauce
Doesn't Work

397
00:18:45,122 --> 00:18:47,210
As A Lymph Tissue Stain.

398
00:18:47,522 --> 00:18:50,061
I'll Try The Coffee.

399
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:51,325
He's Annoyed By Her,

400
00:18:51,326 --> 00:18:53,277
Doesn't Respect Her
As A Doctor,

401
00:18:53,278 --> 00:18:54,832
Constantly Insults Her.

402
00:18:55,142 --> 00:18:57,562
That's House's Version
Of Courtship.

403
00:18:58,348 --> 00:18:59,234
Oh, God.

404
00:18:59,235 --> 00:19:00,630
He's Been Wooing Me
For Years.

405
00:19:00,631 --> 00:19:02,374
She's The Perfect Woman
For Him.

406
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,343
Willing To Literally Go
To The End Of The Earth

407
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:05,296
For Her Career,

408
00:19:05,297 --> 00:19:08,111
Making Her Unavailable
For A Real Relationship.

409
00:19:08,332 --> 00:19:10,741
And She's Afflicted
With A Mysterious Illness.

410
00:19:10,742 --> 00:19:12,911
Soy Sauce Is A No-Go.

411
00:19:13,522 --> 00:19:15,222
We're Gonna Be Here
All Night.

412
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,144
How Long Does It Take You
To Get Naked?

413
00:19:18,215 --> 00:19:19,711
<I>It's The South Pole.</I>

414
00:19:20,173 --> 00:19:21,879
I Wear A Lot Of Layers.

415
00:19:23,461 --> 00:19:25,962
Okay, Ready.

416
00:19:25,963 --> 00:19:28,080
Bah!
I Saw Socks.

417
00:19:28,081 --> 00:19:29,245
That's Not Naked.

418
00:19:29,246 --> 00:19:30,903
Have I Mentioned
It's Freezing Here?

419
00:19:30,904 --> 00:19:33,247
When They Discover Lymph Nodes
In Feet,

420
00:19:33,248 --> 00:19:35,038
I Will Take Off My Socks.

421
00:19:35,815 --> 00:19:38,597
Use Your Right Hand
To Palpate The Nodes.

422
00:19:38,748 --> 00:19:41,492
<I>Any Node You Can Feel
Is One You Can Biopsy.</I>

423
00:19:41,734 --> 00:19:43,598
Let's Start With Your Breasts,

424
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:45,449
Move Down To The Ass,
Then-

425
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,967
<I>I Was Thinking</I>

426
00:19:47,025 --> 00:19:48,739
Go From The Neck
And Work My Way Down.

427
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,116
Well You Could,

428
00:19:50,505 --> 00:19:51,854
But I'd Never Forgive Myself

429
00:19:51,855 --> 00:19:54,784
If We Found Something Before
We Got To Your Breasts.

430
00:19:55,498 --> 00:19:58,322
I'm Starting With
The Anterior Cervical Nodes.

431
00:20:03,878 --> 00:20:05,570
Turn Your Head.

432
00:20:05,749 --> 00:20:08,175
Locate The Scm Muscle.

433
00:20:08,348 --> 00:20:10,348
I Know How To Find
My Lymph Nodes.

434
00:20:10,349 --> 00:20:12,518
They Teach You That Before
Or After The Class

435
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:14,809
On Fondling Your Inner Child?

436
00:20:16,681 --> 00:20:19,040
<I>No Swelling,
No Tenderness,</I>

437
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:22,256
And I Can Hear That, House.

438
00:20:22,649 --> 00:20:24,593
Just Thought
It Might Help You Relax.

439
00:20:26,284 --> 00:20:28,559
Anything In The Axillary Nodes?

440
00:20:28,954 --> 00:20:30,633
All Clear.

441
00:20:31,837 --> 00:20:33,373
Both Sides.

442
00:20:33,989 --> 00:20:37,087
Slide Your Hand
To Your Sternum,

443
00:20:38,197 --> 00:20:39,861
<I>Probe For Nodes.</I>

444
00:20:39,862 --> 00:20:43,094
Moving Slowly Downward.

445
00:20:43,301 --> 00:20:44,931
Down To What, House?

446
00:20:44,932 --> 00:20:46,107
Sorry, Can't Hear You

447
00:20:46,108 --> 00:20:48,068
On Account
Of Your Heavy Breathing.

448
00:20:48,069 --> 00:20:50,354
I'm Supposed To Be
On Oxygen, You Tool.

449
00:20:55,866 --> 00:20:56,916
Hold It.

450
00:20:57,106 --> 00:20:59,131
<I>Your Fingers Didn't Go
Quite As Deep.</I>

451
00:20:59,302 --> 00:21:00,968
Feel That Node Again.

452
00:21:02,007 --> 00:21:03,750
It-It's Swollen.

453
00:21:06,122 --> 00:21:08,477
Looks Like You're Doing
A Biopsy.

454
00:21:19,257 --> 00:21:20,824
It's Pretty Numb.

455
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:23,479
<I>Okay, Take A Deep Breath</I>

456
00:21:23,641 --> 00:21:26,393
<I>And Insert The Needle
Into The Node.</I>

457
00:21:28,178 --> 00:21:29,190
Come On, Cate.

458
00:21:29,191 --> 00:21:31,036
Let's Get This Over With.

459
00:21:33,022 --> 00:21:35,020
You Used Her Name.

460
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:39,457
Just Trying To Move Things
Along, Bob.

461
00:21:47,918 --> 00:21:49,486
Okay, I'm In.

462
00:21:49,487 --> 00:21:51,944
You Need To Pull Back
On The Syringe.

463
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,697
You Need To Pull Harder.

464
00:22:06,571 --> 00:22:07,923
You Okay?

465
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,041
Yeah.

466
00:22:12,432 --> 00:22:13,679
"Are You Okay?"

467
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,123
It's A Valid Medical Question.

468
00:22:15,124 --> 00:22:17,497
I Have Never Heard You
Ask A Patient That Question.

469
00:22:17,498 --> 00:22:18,897
<I>You've Never Asked Me
That Question,</I>

470
00:22:18,898 --> 00:22:21,441
And You've Seen Me Fall Down
A Flight Of Stairs Drunk.

471
00:22:22,653 --> 00:22:24,505
You've Slept With Her.

472
00:22:24,933 --> 00:22:27,227
She's 9,000 Miles Away.

473
00:22:27,917 --> 00:22:29,681
And While A Certain Part Of Me
Unfurled-

474
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:30,901
No, You-

475
00:22:30,902 --> 00:22:34,562
Somehow You've Been Intimate
With Her.

476
00:22:34,705 --> 00:22:36,284
Why Are You Following Me?

477
00:22:37,047 --> 00:22:38,108
Thought You Were Following Me.

478
00:22:38,109 --> 00:22:39,778
No, You Are Definitely
Following Me.

479
00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:41,193
Where Are You Going?
Out To Lunch.

480
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:42,552
You Never Go Out
To Lunch.

481
00:22:42,553 --> 00:22:44,271
Means There's A Reason
You're Going Out To Lunch.

482
00:22:44,272 --> 00:22:45,970
I Assume That Reason
Is A Human Being.

483
00:22:45,971 --> 00:22:47,470
Or A Sandwich.

484
00:22:47,471 --> 00:22:48,850
Sandwiches Can Come Here.

485
00:22:48,851 --> 00:22:49,926
So Can Human Beings.

486
00:22:49,927 --> 00:22:51,919
Yet She's Not,
Which I Find Interesting.

487
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,440
I'm Leaving Now.

488
00:22:53,601 --> 00:22:54,849
Small World.

489
00:22:55,514 --> 00:22:58,909
Are You Going To Follow Me
Into My Car?

490
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:00,659
It's Got Two Doors.

491
00:23:00,736 --> 00:23:02,244
Okay, Look-

492
00:23:02,245 --> 00:23:04,978
The Reason I Haven't Told You
Is-

493
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,762
Call Off Your Dogs,
House.

494
00:23:12,817 --> 00:23:14,657
Your Little Helpers
Are Interrogating My Patients,

495
00:23:14,658 --> 00:23:15,542
Swiping My Charts,

496
00:23:15,543 --> 00:23:16,847
Intercepting Prescriptions.

497
00:23:16,848 --> 00:23:18,051
Why Would You Think
That I'm-

498
00:23:18,052 --> 00:23:19,659
Because I'm Not A Moron.

499
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,845
You Had To Be Pulling
The Strings Here.

500
00:23:21,846 --> 00:23:23,360
You Think That Because
They Make Me Miserable

501
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:24,828
I'm Gonna Give You Cable?

502
00:23:25,343 --> 00:23:26,765
Let's Assume
That's True.

503
00:23:26,766 --> 00:23:28,533
And It Certainly Sounds
Like It Might Be.

504
00:23:28,534 --> 00:23:29,252
What Are You Gonna Do?

505
00:23:29,253 --> 00:23:30,166
Nothing.

506
00:23:30,246 --> 00:23:31,965
I Resigned
From The Budget Committee.

507
00:23:31,966 --> 00:23:34,044
I Only Joined The Committee
To Help The Hospital.

508
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:35,421
You Made Me A Liability.

509
00:23:35,422 --> 00:23:36,907
I Now Have Zero Influence

510
00:23:36,908 --> 00:23:39,542
Over The Hospital's
Cable Policy.

511
00:23:49,301 --> 00:23:50,513
Well Done.

512
00:23:50,705 --> 00:23:52,478
It Didn't Work.
There's Nothing More That-

513
00:23:52,479 --> 00:23:53,843
Put These Up.

514
00:23:55,545 --> 00:23:57,075
"Free Rottweiler Puppies.

515
00:23:57,076 --> 00:24:00,207
<I>Please Call After 11:00 Pm
And Before 5:00 Am."</I>

516
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:01,349
Is This Cameron's
Home Number?

517
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,687
I Love A New Puppy.

518
00:24:03,254 --> 00:24:04,788
That Last One
Was Delicious.

519
00:24:04,789 --> 00:24:07,271
In Torturing Her.S No Point

520
00:24:07,272 --> 00:24:09,493
If She Can Resign,
She Can Unresign.

521
00:24:09,494 --> 00:24:10,994
Go To Defcon One.

522
00:24:10,995 --> 00:24:12,269
Forget Waiting For A Mistake,

523
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,121
Make Her Make One.

524
00:24:13,122 --> 00:24:15,542
You Want Us To Sabotage
Another Doctor,

525
00:24:15,543 --> 00:24:17,055
Possibly Harm A Patient,

526
00:24:17,056 --> 00:24:18,522
All So You Can Have Cable.

527
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:20,616
Harm Suggests Permanent Damage.

528
00:24:20,617 --> 00:24:22,624
Get Her To Screw Up,
Then Fix It.

529
00:24:22,756 --> 00:24:24,806
Oh, And This Time
Don't Tell Her

530
00:24:24,807 --> 00:24:26,542
What You're Gonna Do
Before You Do It.

531
00:24:28,714 --> 00:24:32,272
So, Um, How Long
Do I Let The Lymph Node

532
00:24:32,273 --> 00:24:34,370
Marinate In The Red Wine?

533
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,382
It Should Be Ready Now.

534
00:24:39,802 --> 00:24:42,611
Try Increasing The Magnification
On The Camera.

535
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:44,574
You Know, I E-Mailed
A Couple Colleagues

536
00:24:44,575 --> 00:24:45,859
At The Hospital About You.

537
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,943
You're Checking Up On Me,
Not House?

538
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:51,540
Yeah, Well House
Is Straightforward,

539
00:24:51,541 --> 00:24:53,383
Brilliant, And An Ass.

540
00:24:53,384 --> 00:24:54,668
Two Out Of Three Good Qualities,

541
00:24:54,669 --> 00:24:55,920
Clear Majority.

542
00:24:55,921 --> 00:24:57,531
Whereas You,
On The Other Hand,

543
00:24:57,532 --> 00:24:59,549
Have A Perfect Score.

544
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:03,750
You Are Responsible,
Nice, Human.

545
00:25:03,751 --> 00:25:05,879
And Yet You're House's
Best Friend.

546
00:25:06,147 --> 00:25:07,201
<I>Hold There.</I>

547
00:25:07,202 --> 00:25:09,901
Makes You Think He's Secretly
Nicer Than He Seems?

548
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:11,772
Makes Me Think That
You're Secretly

549
00:25:11,773 --> 00:25:13,518
A Lot Less Nice
Than You Seem.

550
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:15,176
Do You Always Insult
Your Doctors?

551
00:25:15,177 --> 00:25:16,824
<I>It's Not An Insult.</I>

552
00:25:16,825 --> 00:25:19,189
Indiscriminate Niceness
Is Overrated.

553
00:25:19,967 --> 00:25:21,494
No Wonder He Likes You.

554
00:25:24,957 --> 00:25:28,929
Based On This Slide,
You Do Not Have Cancer.

555
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:31,720
Oh.

556
00:25:31,721 --> 00:25:32,926
Thank God.

557
00:25:32,927 --> 00:25:35,293
I Do See Some Inflammation
Which Could Mean-

558
00:25:35,294 --> 00:25:36,723
Ah-Mm-

559
00:25:36,724 --> 00:25:37,839
<I>Cate?</I>

560
00:25:37,895 --> 00:25:38,846
You All Right?

561
00:25:38,847 --> 00:25:40,714
My Left Side... Hurts.

562
00:25:41,095 --> 00:25:42,290
Um...

563
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:44,743
It's The Same Pain
That I Had On The Right.

564
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,194
Your Other Kidney.

565
00:25:46,195 --> 00:25:49,319
No, I Hope It's Something, Um-
It's Maybe-

566
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,465
Ah!

567
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:53,176
Oh, No!
I'm Screwed.

568
00:25:58,985 --> 00:26:02,667
<I>Bad News Is You're 0 For 2
In The Kidney Department.</I>

569
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:04,649
Is There Good News?

570
00:26:05,115 --> 00:26:06,470
You're Back At Home.

571
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:09,088
Of Course.
There's Cable.

572
00:26:09,136 --> 00:26:10,944
And The Freedom To Work
Pant-Free.

573
00:26:10,945 --> 00:26:12,761
That Is Good News.

574
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:16,474
Wilson Found Signs
Of Inflammation In Your Biopsy.

575
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:17,916
That Plus
The Two Failing Kidneys

576
00:26:17,917 --> 00:26:19,387
Points To Autoimmune Disease.

577
00:26:19,388 --> 00:26:21,157
Probably Sle Or Vasculitis.

578
00:26:21,158 --> 00:26:22,962
Treatment For Both
Is Prednisone.

579
00:26:23,096 --> 00:26:24,363
Start With 100 Milligrams-

580
00:26:24,364 --> 00:26:26,354
Autoimmune Is Just
Your Latest Theory.

581
00:26:26,355 --> 00:26:27,821
Like Cancer Before That,

582
00:26:27,822 --> 00:26:29,148
And A Kidney Stone Before.

583
00:26:29,149 --> 00:26:31,492
Take The Prednisone,
You'll Get Better,

584
00:26:31,493 --> 00:26:32,694
That'll Be Your Confirmation.

585
00:26:32,695 --> 00:26:34,836
You Practice Medicine
Like It's A Fire Sale.

586
00:26:34,837 --> 00:26:37,399
You've Wasted Antibiotics,
X- Rays-

587
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,647
That Was Not A Waste.

588
00:26:38,648 --> 00:26:39,465
We Ruled Out-

589
00:26:39,466 --> 00:26:40,567
<I>We Have A Crew Member Here</I>

590
00:26:40,568 --> 00:26:41,470
Who Has Asthma.

591
00:26:41,471 --> 00:26:42,728
If He Has An Episode

592
00:26:42,729 --> 00:26:45,559
After I've Used Up
The Prednisone, He'll Die.

593
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,235
There's A Good Chance
He's Gonna Die Anyway,

594
00:26:47,236 --> 00:26:49,003
Since There Won't Be
A Doctor There To Help Him.

595
00:26:49,004 --> 00:26:52,962
Show Me Proof
That It's Autoimmune

596
00:26:53,105 --> 00:26:55,096
And Then I'll Take
The Prednisone.

597
00:27:00,566 --> 00:27:02,441
We Should Send Her Outside.

598
00:27:02,553 --> 00:27:04,429
Right, Just Tell Her
To Head North

599
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:05,859
Until She Runs Into
A Hospital.

600
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,568
Autoimmune Diseases
Are Basically

601
00:27:07,569 --> 00:27:08,986
Inflammation Running Wild.

602
00:27:08,987 --> 00:27:10,901
Extreme Cold Has Been Used
As Treatment,

603
00:27:10,902 --> 00:27:12,701
Like Putting Ice
On A Sprained Ankle.

604
00:27:12,702 --> 00:27:14,219
She Starts To Feel Better
Outside,

605
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,748
We Know It's Autoimmune.

606
00:27:15,864 --> 00:27:17,347
Is That My Wallet?

607
00:27:17,403 --> 00:27:18,838
Yeah, You Can Have It Back.

608
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:20,234
I've Already Been Through It.

609
00:27:20,542 --> 00:27:22,370
<I>I Like Your
"Ice On A Sprain" Metaphor.</I>

610
00:27:22,371 --> 00:27:24,434
<I>Makes It Seem Like
We're Not Killing Her.</I>

611
00:27:24,435 --> 00:27:26,267
She'd Only Need To Be Outside
Five Minutes.

612
00:27:26,268 --> 00:27:27,553
Without Her Mittens.

613
00:27:27,554 --> 00:27:29,481
Mom Told Me That
Was A Bad Idea.

614
00:27:29,624 --> 00:27:30,750
<I>Especially That Winter</I>

615
00:27:30,751 --> 00:27:33,239
It Was 70 Below
And I Had Dual Kidney Failure.

616
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,364
This Is A Good Idea.

617
00:27:34,365 --> 00:27:35,449
It's Perfect For You-

618
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:37,335
<I>Experimental, Risky.</I>

619
00:27:37,855 --> 00:27:38,982
Wilson's Right.

620
00:27:38,983 --> 00:27:39,686
You Care About-

621
00:27:39,687 --> 00:27:40,810
You Didn't Touch The Cash,

622
00:27:40,811 --> 00:27:42,636
But You Took
The Receipts?

623
00:27:45,201 --> 00:27:47,410
$190 Restaurant Tab.

624
00:27:47,411 --> 00:27:50,062
<I>That's Dessert,
Probably Booze.</I>

625
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:51,079
Means You Lingered.

626
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,418
Means It's At Least
The Third Date.

627
00:27:53,989 --> 00:27:55,300
Means-
Where Are You Going?

628
00:27:55,301 --> 00:27:56,360
To Talk To The People I Pay

629
00:27:56,361 --> 00:27:57,776
To Come Up With Medical Ideas.

630
00:27:57,777 --> 00:27:59,653
<I>There Are No Ideas.</I>

631
00:27:59,836 --> 00:28:01,548
The Test For Autoimmune
Is A.N.A.

632
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:03,925
Unless Penguins Poop
Immuno Analyzers, She's Not-

633
00:28:03,926 --> 00:28:05,461
<I>Before A.N.A. Testing,</I>

634
00:28:05,466 --> 00:28:07,497
People Had Autoimmune Diseases.

635
00:28:07,858 --> 00:28:09,269
How Did They Know?

636
00:28:09,328 --> 00:28:10,541
C3.

637
00:28:10,542 --> 00:28:11,351
Before That.

638
00:28:11,352 --> 00:28:12,283
<I>L.E. Prep.</I>

639
00:28:12,284 --> 00:28:13,061
But She Doesn't Have

640
00:28:13,062 --> 00:28:14,716
<I>Any Controlled Pore
Glass Beads.</I>

641
00:28:14,717 --> 00:28:16,056
You Don't Need Them.

642
00:28:22,005 --> 00:28:23,057
<I>When You Shake
The Test Tube,</I>

643
00:28:23,058 --> 00:28:25,947
<I>The Paperclip Will Damage
Some Of Your Blood Cells.</I>

644
00:28:26,099 --> 00:28:27,522
<I>If You Have An Autoimmune
Disease,</I>

645
00:28:27,523 --> 00:28:29,392
<I>Your Immune System
Will Gorge Itself</I>

646
00:28:29,393 --> 00:28:30,749
<I>On The Damaged Cells.</I>

647
00:28:31,077 --> 00:28:31,998
They'll Get Big And Fat

648
00:28:31,999 --> 00:28:33,760
So You Can See 'Em
Under A Microscope.

649
00:28:34,518 --> 00:28:35,872
How You Doing?

650
00:28:36,249 --> 00:28:37,590
No Change.

651
00:28:37,832 --> 00:28:39,404
So How Long Should
I Give The Cells

652
00:28:39,405 --> 00:28:41,506
To Fatten Up Before
I Check Them?

653
00:28:41,625 --> 00:28:43,060
Couple Hours.

654
00:28:43,331 --> 00:28:44,927
Or You Could Stop
Being A Hypocrite

655
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:46,012
And Take The Prednisone Now.

656
00:28:46,013 --> 00:28:48,527
Not Bending To Your Will
Makes Me A Hypocrite?

657
00:28:48,573 --> 00:28:51,278
If Your Psych Patients
Demanded Lab Results,

658
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,921
You'd Never Make A Diagnosis.

659
00:28:52,922 --> 00:28:53,994
So I'm Wrong.

660
00:28:53,995 --> 00:28:55,249
You Sleep Like A Baby,

661
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:57,259
<I>Your Life Is Unfolding
As You Dreamed.</I>

662
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:59,148
Everyone Is Miserable.

663
00:28:59,396 --> 00:29:01,512
You Don't Change That
Because People Don't Change.

664
00:29:01,513 --> 00:29:02,581
You Want To Believe That

665
00:29:02,582 --> 00:29:04,505
Because Then You're Freed
From Any Responsibility

666
00:29:04,506 --> 00:29:05,499
<I>For Your Misery.</I>

667
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,923
Oh, Shut Up.

668
00:29:07,713 --> 00:29:09,245
I Get Enough Of This
From Wilson.

669
00:29:09,246 --> 00:29:11,208
And Yet You Keep Hanging Out
With Him.

670
00:29:12,739 --> 00:29:14,473
And From What I Hear,

671
00:29:14,474 --> 00:29:16,622
You Have Spent More Time
With Me

672
00:29:16,623 --> 00:29:18,286
Than With Any Other Patient.

673
00:29:21,825 --> 00:29:23,403
Sorry About That.

674
00:29:24,521 --> 00:29:26,333
Call Me When You Get
The Results.

675
00:29:32,916 --> 00:29:34,134
How's Your Patient?

676
00:29:34,732 --> 00:29:36,587
She Has
An Autoimmune Disease.

677
00:29:36,621 --> 00:29:38,974
Tell The Psych Department
She's In Denial.

678
00:29:41,191 --> 00:29:42,658
I Had To Fire Cameron.

679
00:29:42,999 --> 00:29:45,257
What?
What Happened?

680
00:29:45,258 --> 00:29:47,305
65-Year-Old Man
Came Into The E.R.

681
00:29:47,306 --> 00:29:48,802
With A Hip Fracture.

682
00:29:48,941 --> 00:29:50,741
Cameron Gave Him Demerol.

683
00:29:50,742 --> 00:29:52,254
The Guy Was
On An M.A.O.I.

684
00:29:52,255 --> 00:29:54,188
Put Him
Into A Hypertensive Crisis.

685
00:29:54,189 --> 00:29:55,078
Is He Gonna Live?

686
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:57,046
Taub Caught The Error
In Time.

687
00:29:57,286 --> 00:29:59,103
If She'd Just Admitted
The Mistake,

688
00:29:59,104 --> 00:30:00,612
Maybe I Could've Just
Suspended Her.

689
00:30:00,613 --> 00:30:03,245
<I>But She's Packing Up,</I>

690
00:30:03,336 --> 00:30:04,395
If You Want To Say Good-Bye.

691
00:30:04,396 --> 00:30:05,965
We Should Be Hearing
From The South Pole

692
00:30:05,966 --> 00:30:07,258
In A Few Minutes.

693
00:30:07,696 --> 00:30:08,871
That's It?

694
00:30:09,553 --> 00:30:11,050
There's Nothing To Be Done.

695
00:30:11,051 --> 00:30:12,017
She Screwed Up.

696
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:14,495
She's Got No One To Blame
But Herself.

697
00:30:17,271 --> 00:30:18,803
I Gotta Go Talk
To Cameron.

698
00:30:18,804 --> 00:30:20,498
Cuddy Wouldn't Can Her
For One Screw-Up.

699
00:30:20,499 --> 00:30:22,495
And If She Did,
She Wouldn't Come To Me.

700
00:30:22,496 --> 00:30:23,956
And If She Did,
She Wouldn't Open With,

701
00:30:23,957 --> 00:30:24,949
"How's Your Patient."

702
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,896
<I>And If She Did-
Why Would She Lie?</I>

703
00:30:26,596 --> 00:30:28,219
Timeless Question.

704
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,300
In This Case, She Conspired
With Your Coworkers

705
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,600
To Teach Me
That Some Things

706
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,700
Are More Important
Than Cable.

707
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,500
And I'm Gonna Have To Teach Them
That They're Wrong.

708
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,000
Come On, South Pole
Really Should Be Calling.

709
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,300
L.E. Prep Test Was Negative.

710
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,900
It's Not Autoimmune.

711
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:49,000
You're Basing That On A Test
Done With A Paperclip.

712
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,200
Just Take The Prednisone.

713
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,300
Either Find Another Diagnosis

714
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,600
Or Find Another Test.

715
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,700
There Is One Way.

716
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,200
You Can Take This Experimental
Drug Called...

717
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,100
Prednisone!

718
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,800
Your Kidneys Start Working-

719
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,300
There Is Another Test.

720
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,500
Oh, I-I Think Foreman
May've Just Broken Up There.

721
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,600
What He Actually Said Was

722
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,600
"There Is No Other Test."

723
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,000
If You Have
An Autoimmune Disease,

724
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,500
Exposure To The Cold

725
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,600
Should Decrease
Your Kidney Pain.

726
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,500
If I Go Outside,
We'll Have Our Answer?

727
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,900
And You Knew About This?

728
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,400
I Rejected It Because
If You're Frozen Solid,

729
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,500
It's Hard To Get The Needles
Into Your Arms.

730
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,000
How Long Do I Need
To Stay Out?

731
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,300
At Least Five Minutes.

732
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,600
Eight Minutes Outside
Would Kill A Healthy Person.

733
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,900
And Healthy People Don't
Suck On Oxygen Masks.

734
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,300
Healthy People
Can Pee.

735
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,300
I'll Go Get Sean,
Have Him Come With Me.

736
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,300
Just Take The Prednisone.

737
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,900
Once I Come Inside.

738
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,600
If It's Autoimmune.

739
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,600
Are You All Right?

740
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,400
Oh, I'm Sure
She's Just Fine.

741
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,400
Cate?

742
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,200
See If There's Anye
Down There

743
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,800
Who Has A Cell Phone.

744
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,100
Took The Station Mechanic
20 Minutes To Respond.

745
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,800
She'd Already Slipped
Into A Coma.

746
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,900
Started Her On Prednisone,
But No Improvement.

747
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,900
Means It's Not Autoimmune.

748
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,900
Good Thing She's In A Coma,

749
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,000
Or We'd Have To Listen
To Her Gloat.

750
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:28,800
And Where Are We Going?

751
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,000
To Find The Useful Members
Of My Team.

752
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,400
You're Letting Him
Off The Hook?

753
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,000
Happy?

754
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,700
Because Of You,
I'm Not Gonna Be Able

755
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,700
To Watch Law And Order
In Korean

756
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,400
Why Am I Here?

757
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,400
Because I Want To Ask You
About Your Girlfriend.

758
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,700
I Must Know Who She Is

759
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,900
Or You'd Have Told Me
Her Name.

760
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
She Doesn't Have A Name.

761
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,200
It's Some Sort
Of Birth Defect.

762
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,100
There's Only About
12 People We Both Know.

763
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,200
I Can't Remember
Five Of Their Names,

764
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,400
So We're Down To...

765
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,200
Cuddy..Your Ex-Wife

766
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,200
Your Mama.

767
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,100
You Need To Run
A Kidney Function Test.

768
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,200
Yes, If Only
She Wasn't In A Coma

769
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,700
We Could Get Her To Run
A Test To Find Out

770
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,000
Why She's In A Coma.

771
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,600
The Results Would Likely
Be Paradoxical.

772
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,800
Can't Be Cuddy,
'Cause You're Straight.

773
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:08,700
Can't Be-

774
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,600
We Could Talk The Mechanic
Through The Test.

775
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,100
Too Complicated.

776
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,600
Unless He's Thirsty.

777
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,800
Drink Her Urine?

778
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,800
If It Has A Strong,
Concentrated Taste,

779
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,900
It Means The Problem's
In Her Kidneys.

780
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,000
Watery Taste Means
It's Her Brain

781
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,100
And Then You Can Fix It?

782
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,000
Let's Say Yeah.

783
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,000
How Do I Get The Urine
Out Of Her?

784
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,600
Take A Straight Catheter
And Insert It-

785
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,200
These Are Your Only Questions?

786
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,700
Not, "Is It Safe?"

787
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,300
Or, "Is There Another Way?"

788
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,700
Or, "Are You Out
Of Your Minds?"

789
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,500
You Wouldn't Ask Me If-

790
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,800
Wait A Second.

791
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,500
You're In Love With Her.

792
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,300
That Explains Why
You're So Eager

793
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,200
To Get Her Naked,
Then Have A Drink.

794
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,400
'Cause Most Guys Like
To Go The Other Way Around.

795
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,700
Why Do You Care
How I Feel About Her?

796
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,000
Because Now I Know
That I Can Get You

797
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,200
To Do Anything To Save Her.

798
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,000
Tell Him How
To Tap The Keg.

799
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,500
You Got Cameron Fired.

800
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,700
Uh, Cuddy Wasn't Supposed
To Find Out.

801
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,800
No Kidding!

802
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,800
Get Me Cable.
How Tough Can That Be?

803
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,200
Cost A Woman
Her Job.

804
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,400
There's Only One Thing
You Can Say

805
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,900
To Keep Me From Firing You.

806
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,700
Cameron Wasn't Fired.

807
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,200
Wrong.

808
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,000
You Know?

809
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,000
We'r Still Fired?

810
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:33,800
That Should Be A Hint

811
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,500
As To What You're Supposed
To Say.

812
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,100
We're Sorry.

813
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:37,800
Wrong.

814
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,700
I Love You.

815
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,400
Wrong.

816
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,600
This Is A Game?

817
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,000
First We Have To Screw
With Our Coworker

818
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,400
And Now We Have To Try
To Figure Out

819
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,500
What You Want Us To Say?

820
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,600
This Is Insane.
I'm Not Playing.

821
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,600
Right.

822
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,600
Should've Said This
Two Days Ago.

823
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,400
Do Not Play Games
With Me.

824
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,000
Number One,
You're Going To Lose.

825
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,200
You're Just Not Ready.

826
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,500
Number Two, The Game
Was To Force You

827
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,200
To Stop Playing Games.

828
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,800
I Need You To Stand Up
To Me.

829
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:05,600
Challenge Me.

830
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,800
I Need You To Stop Worrying

831
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,200
About Getting Fired.

832
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,500
Go Pay For My Cable.

833
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,100
No!

834
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,300
I Didn't Mean On This.

835
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,300
Seriously, I Need Cable.

836
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,700
Milk, Milk, Lemonade.

837
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,900
Uh, This Tastes Kind Of Watery.

838
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,500
That's Bad News.

839
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,800
Either Increased
Intracranial Pressure

840
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,900
Or Something's Wrong
With Her Hypothalamus.

841
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,600
How Do You Figure Out
Which One It Is?

842
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,900
We Don't Do Anything.

843
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,300
You're Gonna Drill
A Hole In Her Skull.

844
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,900
If She Regains Consciousness,

845
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,700
It's Increased
Intracranial Pressure.

846
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,500
And If It's The Other Thing?

847
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,800
She'll Die.

848
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,500
But If It's The Hypothalamus,
She's Dead Anyway.

849
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,800
If The Problem Is The Pressure

850
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,500
In Her Brain,
And I Fix It,

851
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,700
Is She Gonna Be All Better?

852
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Nope, But It'll Give Us
More Time

853
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,300
To Figure Out What's Wrong.

854
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,200
I Have To Get Someone Else.
I Can't Do This.

855
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,100
You Love Her, Right?

856
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,400
You'd Do Anything
To Save Her.

857
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,400
Not This.

858
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,600
I Can't Do This.

859
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,300
If-If She Dies Because
Of Something

860
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,300
That I Did, Then I-

861
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,100
Listen, Listen.

862
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,800
I Am Not Going
To Let You Hurt Her.

863
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:31,500
Okay?

864
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,400
Now Please...

865
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,000
This Is Her Only Chance.

866
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,300
Okay.

867
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,300
Well, That Was Easy.

868
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,000
Okay, Her Head Is Stabilized

869
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:00,700
And The Drill Bit
Is Sterile.

870
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,400
Place The Drill Bit Against

871
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,600
The Upper Left Part
Of Her Forehead.

872
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,100
About An Inch Above
The Temple.

873
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,300
It's Not Going Anywhere.

874
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,200
Bone's Harder Than Wood.
Lean Into It.

875
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,100
The Skull's Only
A Quarter-Inch Thick.

876
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:32,000
Once You're Midway Through,
Drill In Shorter Bursts.

877
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,400
If It Comes Out
The Other Side,

878
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,400
You've Gone Too Far.

879
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,600
Okay, Now What?
Now What?

880
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,800
Let The Fluid Drain.

881
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,900
She's Waking Up.
She's Waking Up.

882
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Sean?

883
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,300
What's Going On?

884
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,900
South Pole Doc
Is Out Of Her Coma,

885
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,300
And Now We Have
A New Symptom:

886
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,700
Increased Intracranial
Pressure.

887
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,400
Why Are We Out Here?

888
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,300
That's The Patient Room.

889
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,100
Icp Plus Kidney Problems

890
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,800
Plus Lung Collapse Equals?

891
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:29,800
The Most Likely Suspect

892
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,200
Is A Tumor
Throwing Off Clots.

893
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,300
We Ruled Out Cancer.

894
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,600
But Not Clots.

895
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,500
What Causes Blood Clots?

896
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,200
Bacterial Endocarditis.

897
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,300
Not Without A Fever.

898
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,400
Deep Vein Thrombosis Plus
An Existing Pfo.

899
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,500
Pfo Would've Been Discovered

900
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,500
In Her Pre-South Pole
Physical Exam.

901
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,800
What If The Clots
Aren't Clots?

902
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,100
Atherosclerosis.

903
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,300
Fatty Plaque Builds Up
On The Arterial Walls,

904
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,200
Pieces Break Off,
Block Blood Flow.

905
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,500
Explains Everything.

906
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,200
She Has Zero Risk Factors.

907
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,300
Forget Fat, Think Clots.

908
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,400
No.

909
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,900
You're Standing Up To Me?

910
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,100
Maybe.

911
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,200
Just To Clarify.

912
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,500
You Should Do That
When You're Right.

913
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,100
Sorry For The Confusion.

914
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,400
How Could A Clot-

915
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,300
Could Be A Different Kind
Of Fat, Fat Emboli.

916
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,900
That's A Perfect Fit...

917
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,600
Except It's Completely
Impossible!

918
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,900
Fat Emboli Requires
An Unrepaired Bone Break.

919
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:18,900
Between The X-Ray
And The Exam,

920
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,600
I've Seen Her Entire-

921
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,100
See, That's What
I'm Talking About.

922
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,100
Take Off Her Socks.

923
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,100
I Could-I Could Do It.

924
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,200
No, I Got It.

925
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,000
Your Toe Is Broken.

926
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,600
Oh, My God.

927
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,800
Bits Of Bone Marrow

928
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,000
Have Been Leaking
Into Your Blood Stream.

929
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,000
Those Fat Emboli
Have Caused Blockages

930
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,800
In Your Kidney, Lungs,
And Brain.

931
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
It Doesn't Even Hurt.

932
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,800
Cold Numbs Everything.

933
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,500
Does A Particularly Great Job
On The Extremities.

934
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,000
You'll Need To Close
The Break

935
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,500
So Stop The Marrow
From Leaking.

936
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
This One You Will Feel.

937
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,900
Will You Do It?

938
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,800
He Drilled A Hole
In Your Skull

939
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:19,900
After Drinking Your Pee.

940
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,100
I Think He's Up For This.

941
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,200
Grab The Tip Of Her Toe
With Your Right Hand.

942
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,500
Hold The Break With Your Other.

943
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,700
On The Count Of Three,
Pull Hard.

944
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,100
One... Two...

945
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,000
Three.

946
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,900
Now Splint Your Toe.

947
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,000
You'll Be Fine.

948
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,900
Thank You, House.

949
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,000
Don't Thank Me.

950
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
He's The One
Who Saved Your Life.

951
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,400
He Likes Her.

952
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,200
A Bottle Of The Bordeaux

953
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,400
And Some Sparkling Water.

954
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,100
Well, You
Didn't Pick Her Up.

955
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,600
Which Means She's Coming
From Work Too.

956
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,500
Which Means You're
Comfortable Enough To Meet Her.

957
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,200
Damn.

958
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,600
Thought I Lost You
When I Walked Backwards

959
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,300
Through My Own Footprints
In The Snow.

960
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,500
I Think I've Got It
Narrowed Down

961
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,000
To Three Possibilities.

962
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,100
Better Leave.

963
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,400
If You See Her,
It'll Be Cheating.

964
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,000
It's Not One
Of Your Ex-Wives.

965
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,000
Because They Hate Me.

966
00:41:59,100 --> 00:41:59,500
They Don't.

967
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,200
They Should, But They Don't.

968
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,000
I Called Them.

969
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,600
Someone New,

970
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,000
But Someone I Know.

971
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,900
Did You Ever Consider
Being Happy For Me?

972
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:07,700
Briefly.

973
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:11,000
You Ordering The Wine
Before She Got Here.

974
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,800
Girls Are Good, House.

975
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:14,800
And You Know It.

976
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,200
You Solved Your Case

977
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,800
Because You Cared
About That Girl.

978
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,500
You're Demonstrating
The Illusion

979
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,200
Of Manly Confidence.

980
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,200
Which Means You Haven't Closed
The Deal Yet.

981
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,500
I Closed The Deal.
I Just Like Her.

982
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,500
Still?

983
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:29,100
You Knew Your Patient
Hated Having Cold Feet

984
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,300
Because You Did
A Physical Exam,

985
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,700
Because You Liked Her-

986
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,500
Your Theory Is I Cared,

987
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,200
Therefore I Let Her Keep
Her Socks On?

988
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,200
If That's What Love Is,

989
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,700
Then I Don't Want To Have
Anything To Do With It.

990
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,600
It Starts With Warm Feet,???

991
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,500
Your Mom And I Will Explain
When You're Older.

992
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,600
If I'd Made Her Take Them Off

993
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,900
Like I Should've,
I Would've Seen The Toe

994
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,300
And I Would've Solved The Case
Days Ago.

995
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,700
But You Don't Care
About Her.

996
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,000
Of Course Not.

997
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,400
House Doesn't Care
About Anyone.

998
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,400
Hi.

999
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,200
Sorry I'm Late.

1000
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,500
Cut Throat Bitch?

1001
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,300
I Call Her Amber.

1002
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,400
Was She On Your List?

1003
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:12,500
