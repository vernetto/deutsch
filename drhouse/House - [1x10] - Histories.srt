1
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,281
Hi.

2
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,078
Sounds like a good party.

3
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:21,143
Twenty bucks.
Okay, no problem.

4
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:24,213
I, uh, just--
I got it in here somewhere.

5
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:30,859
Oh, you know, I'm--

6
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:34,297
I'm sorry. I guess I must have
forgotten to go to the machine.

7
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:37,097
Yeah,
and brush your teeth.

8
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,866
Lady, you don't have two cents.

9
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,071
Well, I can-- I can get it from--
from my friend who's inside.

10
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:47,307
He can give it to me,
and then I'll bring it back out to you.
You don't know anybody here.

11
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:52,374
Yes, I do. James. He's blond,
and he's really friendly,
and he's a big talker.

12
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:54,818
I need to see him.

13
00:00:57,657 --> 00:01:00,217
Go on in.

14
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:23,172
James?

15
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:28,248
James?

16
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:29,982
James?
Hi.

17
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:32,820
Do you know where James is?

18
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:36,020
Oh, yeah, he's--
he's around here somewhere.

19
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,702
Let's go find him.

20
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:57,542
James?
Do you know where James is?

21
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:01,348
Where is James?

22
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:03,981
James? James?

23
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:07,026
James? James?

24
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:09,891
- Oh, yeah, he's --
he's around here somewhere.
- Where is he?

25
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:19,463
Please.
I really need to find him.

26
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:33,343
What are you doing?

27
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,589
Bitch!

28
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:54,266
No! She's trying to help me!

29
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,208
Get off her! Get off me!

30
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:00,712
Settle down!

31
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:05,083
Move!

32
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:07,585
Geez.
I didn't touch her.

33
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:11,146
Great.
Now we gotta go to a hospital.

34
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:48,688
Homeless. Admitted 24 hours ago
with a suspected drug overdose.

35
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:51,457
Her tox screen's clean,
but she's still delusional.

36
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:54,967
"Homeless".
Usually means crazy, no money.

37
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:57,969
Cuddy's not gonna be--
We're a teaching hospital.

38
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:00,471
No ID. Doesn't even
seem to know her name.

39
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,475
I got called in because of
some lesions on her arm.

40
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:06,979
Homeless always means no roof.
Leads to too much sun.
No, the lesions were noncancerous.

41
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:10,573
But I noticed a twitch.
Her wrist.

42
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:15,452
You feel that?

43
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:18,615
Sure. I'm human.

44
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:21,159
Make a fist around my fingers
as tight as you can.

45
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:22,922
Squeeze.
I am.

46
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:28,365
All right.

47
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,834
Raise your arms
above your head for me.

48
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,765
She's seizing.

49
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:40,540
- Get me some Ativan.
- She doesn't wanna be discharged.
She's manipulating you.

#https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorazepam Ativan

50
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:46,677
It's real.
Check a finger stick.

51
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:54,793
- Blood sugar's 38.
- I need D-50 I.V. push, stat.

52
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,897
Fake low blood sugar.
Now, that's acting.

53
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,899
The blood sugar was real.

54
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:04,300
She's probably diabetic.
O.D.'d on her own insulin.

55
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:08,607
Room 2032.
Do you have her effects out here?

56
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:12,133
Look, a seizure buys her a place to sleep
while the nice doctors run their tests.

57
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:15,339
Maybe a few free meals.

58
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:18,248
Twenty bucks
says there's insulin in there.

59
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,756
Oh! Wow.
Put this back, please.

60
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,417
What about the twitch?
Her arm moved.

61
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,427
Why fake a twitch?
In case the seizure was too subtle?

62
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,430
The twitch could indicate a tumor,
which could indicate--

63
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,763
A need to see a neurologist,
which is why you called me.

64
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:39,498
Keep an eye on her till 2:00 p.m.
Watch her blood sugar,
give her a nice hot lunch.

65
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:41,597
Then discharge her.

66
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:48,204
- He's wrong.
- Foreman is wrong?

67
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:51,216
The neurologist is wrong
about a neurological problem.

68
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:54,219
He took one look at her
and figured it was a scam.

69
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:56,221
So you figure
he's not being objective.

70
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:59,952
House, the woman had a twitch.
She had a seizure.

71
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:03,689
Both of which Foreman saw?
He just wanted her out the door!

72
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:06,698
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Back up there, big fella.

73
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:09,701
Foreman's the guy
you wanna take a swing at.

74
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:15,400
I just want her
to get some medical attention.

75
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:19,911
That's not even close to being true.

76
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,470
It's something else.
Something personal.

77
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,310
Give me the file.

78
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,623
Looks like this'll be fun.

79
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:38,221
The twitch could be a miniseizure,
unrelated to the diabetes.

80
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:40,162
Brain tumor?

81
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,167
Glad you could join us,
Eric.

82
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,170
What's the differential
for a twitch in the wrist?

83
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,901
The patient's a 30-ish Jane Doe.
I thought I just discharged her.

84
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:51,273
Well, she's my patient.
No harm in a second opinion.

85
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:54,279
A blow to the head?
A subdural hematoma?

86
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:56,440
Read the file.
No evidence of cranial trauma.

87
00:06:56,516 --> 00:07:00,008
- A twitch could indicate a brain tumor.
- Or about a dozen other things!

88
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:03,078
Come on. There's two things
homeless people are good at--

89
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,317
getting sick and running scams.

90
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:08,326
If you're so worried about it
being a brain tumor, get her an M.R.I.

91
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:11,363
- When she's clear on that,
then you can bounce her out of here.
- Well, you've got her all figured out.

92
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:15,492
- I've known a lot more
homeless people than you have.
- Yes, you've got that going for you.

93
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:17,536
How could I have doubted
your medical opinion?

94
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,834
The big question.
You're missing it, all of you.

95
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:23,171
Oh, geez.

96
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:25,540
Who is she?

97
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:29,172
Okay, why are we on this case?
Just because Wilson asked?

98
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:32,445
- Do I need a better reason?
- Well, most people wouldn't . You do.

99
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,657
The only thing
we know for sure about jane Doe
is that her name isn't jane Doe,

100
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:49,462
which means no medical history.

101
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:52,470
Allergies, medication,
previous diagnoses, treatment--

102
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:55,939
We have no baseline,
no context for medical treatment.

103
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:58,203
Wow.
Looks just like insulin.

104
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:02,046
Vomit. Still moist.

105
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:05,675
- What do you think? Couple of days old?
- Ugh! You trying to make me hurl?

106
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:08,345
Yeah.
And here's the big finish.

107
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:11,883
Salty.

108
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,426
Chemical imbalance.

109
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,894
Low magnesium
could cause a twitch.
Or high calcium.

110
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:21,229
- Or it's a coincidence.
The point is, we don't know anything.
- So do the M.R.I. Find out.

111
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,097
The M.R.I. can wait.
Hang a banana bag.

112
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,161
Give her 24 hours
to correct the electrolyte imbalance.
We'll take it from there.

113
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,503
Great. Thanks.

114
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,847
Okay, even if she's not faking,
what's so fascinating about this case?

115
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:41,648
At the moment,
how much you don't want me to take it.

116
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:43,712
That's pretty fascinating.

117
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:50,361
Nice likeness of Dr. Foreman.

118
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:53,887
In fact, he's never looked better.

119
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:58,659
He doesn't like me.
I can tell.

120
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:01,502
It's okay.
He doesn't like me either.

121
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:04,805
Who's James?

122
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:08,278
Ow!
Pain in your head?

123
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:10,747
Get away from me!

124
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:13,717
- No, no, no, no!
- All right, let's cool her out.
One milligram Ativan, push.

125
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:16,050
No!
No, no, no, no, no, no!

126
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:18,056
Hold on.

127
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:19,989
Aah! Aah!

128
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:23,654
She bit me!

129
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:27,893
- Good news is, she's negative
for HIV and Hep "C".

130
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:30,993
Yeah?
I'm getting a tetanus shot.
She's getting an M.R.I.

131
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,562
- There's a two-day wait
for nonemergency M.R.I.'s.
- She's getting an M.R.I! Then she's outta here.

132
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:40,245
But Dr. Terhark specifically said
I'd have the M.R.I. at 10:00.

133
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:43,908
It's almost 11:00,
and I haven't even had the pre-test yet.

134
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:46,918
Sorry. We're a little backed up.

135
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,420
Excuse me.
You're Dr. Terhark's 10:00?

136
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:53,424
I'm Angela Whitney.
I'm meeting my decorator at 11:30.

137
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:55,926
She's coming all the way
from New York.

138
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:58,429
Dr. Terhark promised
I'd be home in time.

139
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:00,488
Ofcourse.

140
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:15,505
She just about prepped
for her M.R.I.?

141
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:18,277
Mrs. Whitney?

142
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:23,116
You tried to steal
someone else's test.

143
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,123
Dr. Terhark
is a plastic surgeon.

144
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:28,786
The woman was
getting a six-month checkup
on her chin implants.

145
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:32,530
- I can't believe you authorized this.
- Really?

146
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:35,658
It sounds exactly
like something I'd do.

147
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,362
She can't have an M.R.I.

148
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:41,969
The C.T. scan shows
she has a surgical pin in her arm.

149
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:45,875
The M.R.I. magnet
would have ripped it out of her body.

150
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:48,209
You like the Alien movies?

151
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,443
You had no medical history.
What were you thinking?

152
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:54,816
We'll surgically remove the pin,
then do the M.R.I.
Does that sound good?

153
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,723
She has an electrolyte imbalance.

154
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,816
Dr. Foreman, a neurologist,
believes this woman
has a brain tumor.

155
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:04,158
- Actually, I--
- Hey, don't ever apologize
for a medical opinion.

156
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,256
If he's right
and we don't do this test,
the patient dies.

157
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:11,360
I realize that you have a specialty
of your own, but does yours have
anything to do with the brain?

158
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:14,235
His does.

159
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,240
Fine.

160
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:20,005
- But nothing more
until you find out who she is.
- How are we supposed to--

161
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,071
Hey! He knows
more homeless people
than any of us.

162
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:28,251
Go check out the hood, dog.

163
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,957
I don't know.

164
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:41,762
I've seen a lot of faces around here,
but I don't think I know her.

165
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,193
Great.

166
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:49,470
Say, I, uh, like that jacket.

167
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:53,239
Yeah, uh,
it's all comin' to me now.

168
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:55,746
I know where she keeps her stuff.

169
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:04,846
Just bats.

170
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,950
I thought the lining
would be thicker.

171
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:31,148
No tumor. Nothing.
Her brain is clear.

172
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:34,482
Which means that girl had surgery
just so you wouldn't get reamed out by Cuddy.

173
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:37,784
Not necessarily.
There could still be something
neurological going on.

174
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:40,052
Sure. She's not conning us.
The M.R.I. is.

175
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:44,187
Not wearing a coat in this weather.
That is so wrong.
She drew these.

176
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,595
They might give us a clue.

177
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:49,600
She sign them?
Her name would be a start.

178
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:53,160
All the mythology, the locations,
they'd all depend on her life experience.

179
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,400
Philadelphia.

180
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:57,465
Look at that skyline.

181
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:59,170
It's very evocative.

182
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:01,008
The Chrysler Building.

183
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,640
- That's a cloud.
- And the Chrysler Building's in New York.

184
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,650
Ehh, I'm getting Philly.

185
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:08,551
And that cactus,
well, it's a-- it's a smashed car.

186
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:12,216
- It's a car accident.
- A cactus in Philadelphia?

187
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,351
Water.
Well, water's October, right?
Obviously.

188
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:20,194
Well, the page number 22,
so that's October 2, 2002.

189
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:23,292
Ergo, the patient was in a car accident
two years ago last October.

190
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:25,997
My goodness.
Was she okay?

191
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:28,005
Broke her arm, I think.

192
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:30,837
They fixed it with this.

193
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:34,508
Surgical pin.

194
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,880
Better than a wallet.
Serial numbers in case of recall,
tied to a patient's name.

195
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:43,411
That's why you insisted on the M.R.I.--
so you could remove
the surgical pin from her arm?

196
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,981
- You didn't think I was gonna do it
to save your sorry ass, did you?

197
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:49,186
You might wanna
take a look at that.

198
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:52,196
Her name is Victoria Matsen,
or at least that's the one she used then.

199
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:55,358
Any hospital
with a record of treating her
should be sending that information.

200
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:57,368
Oh, crap!

201
00:13:57,436 --> 00:14:00,371
Her blood work came back an hour ago.
Magnesium was normal.

202
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:04,000
Did you change her banana bag?
Stopped the magnesium,
started iron dextran for severe anemia.

203
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:06,010
She's allergic to iron dextran.

204
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:11,881
Grab some epi off the code cart.

205
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:16,782
Respiratory arrest.
Call a code!

206
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,586
- You're having an allergic reaction.
Can you speak?

207
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:21,785
She's not getting any air.

208
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,455
Got the epi.

209
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:28,022
- Sats are down in the 80s and dropping.
- We have about another minute.

210
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:43,380
Well, we got her sedated
and stabilized.

211
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:48,079
And you still think
there's nothing wrong with her?
Nothing's changed.

212
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:50,383
You almost killed her.
That's different.

213
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:53,084
And we know who she is.

214
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:56,218
So far, we've heard from three hospitals
with records on Victoria Matsen.

215
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:58,456
Seven visits going back two years.

216
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,465
- Any home addresses?
- The pin in her arm
went in during an E.R. visit.

217
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:04,263
She wasn't conscious,
so they didn't get an address.

218
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:07,237
- The other visits, she gave fake addresses.
- Any treatment for neurological problems?

219
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:09,240
Anything that
might explain the twitch?

220
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:12,471
Last winter,
Jefferson Hospital in Philly.
Got treated for frostbite.

221
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:14,569
Baby, it's cold outside.

222
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:17,411
And depression.
They put her on Prozac.

#https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoxetin Prozac

223
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:20,418
Well, I'd be bummed out too.
Zero degrees, living in a box.

224
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:23,250
Put her back on it.
She cheers up,
she might stop biting people.

225
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:28,055
There's a billing record
from Hartman Hospital last year.
Two appointments, ultrasounds.

226
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:30,288
Doesn't say what for.
Pregnant?

227
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:32,626
Well, only if she was
expecting an elephant.

228
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,893
Appointments
were ten months apart.

229
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:37,902
Kept the first , blew off the second.

230
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,801
Abdominal pain.

231
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:42,136
- Her chart doesn't say--
- Wait a minute.

232
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:44,641
She goes in the first time.

233
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:48,339
They look, they can't find anything.
Ten months later, why should she
subject herself to that again?

234
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,780
Why make a second appointment?
She didn't.

235
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:52,942
The nurse made the appointment.

236
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,647
They were looking--
They were looking for ovarian cancer.

237
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:03,318
You got all of that
from one canceled appointment?

238
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:05,989
With Jerry Lauseng, yeah.
He's an oncologist.

239
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,692
Hang on. Her current blood work
doesn't show cancer.
C.A. 125 is normal.

240
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:14,933
And the cancer wouldn't account
for the alleged twitch
or any of her other alleged symptoms.

241
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:16,770
Actually, it would.

242
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:19,777
Neoplastic syndrome
associated with the cancer...

243
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:23,474
could cause her
to twitch like a bunny
on crystal meth.

#https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methamphetamin

244
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:25,540
Ultrasound her ovaries.

245
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:32,056
- Did you find a brain tumor on her M.R.I.?
- No. Foreman was wrong.

246
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:35,560
I'm starting to wonder about
that guy's medical chops.
Right.

247
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:38,027
- Shelley Diamond.
- Yeah.

248
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:40,657
Dr. House
is ready to see you now.

249
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:44,999
The little ones are licking each other again,
and Harry's got a seeping wart
on his extra toe.

250
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,004
What room should we go to?

251
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:52,699
You know what? I think I might be
coming down with something.

252
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:55,372
Hate to give it to you guys.
Sorry.

253
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:58,382
Oh, yeah. Just walk out.
Like I'm not gonna do anything.

254
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,441
Bye-bye.

255
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,090
Working hard?

256
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:13,097
This stuff's pretty good.

257
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:16,100
Calendraica works
for the Council of Genius.

258
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:18,102
Bad guy is Mr. Fury.

259
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:21,765
Fairly generic, no special skills,
but apparently very well organized.

260
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:25,105
You think you work hard.
Try ruling the universe.

261
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:27,407
You trying to teach me
something here?

262
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:32,712
We got the flowing dress, the ring.
Think the patient was married?

263
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:35,777
Maybe it was a bad break-up.
Maybe he dumped her
'cause she was on drugs.

264
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:39,920
You care about her personal history?
No.

265
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:42,552
Question is, why don't you?

266
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:47,128
I hate to cite a cliché,
but Dad on the streets?

267
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:51,602
- Dad's with Mom.
- They're both living on the streets?

268
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,036
No. On a pension.

269
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:58,736
So, who pissed you off?

270
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,802
Right now, you.

271
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:09,587
Your turn.
You gonna tell me why this case?

272
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:12,089
She's my new girlfriend.
I'm having a tattoo designed.

273
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:14,591
I was hoping
you could find out her name.

274
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:19,597
So she's just another sick person
that kindly Dr. Wilson has made sure
doesn't get lost in the big, ugly system.

275
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:22,600
Yes, I forgot.
I need a reason to give a crap.

276
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:25,603
You're giving two craps.
The metric system
always confuses me.

277
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:27,571
Dr. House?

278
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,940
- Time for Girl Scout cookies already?
- Get me some thin mints.

279
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:36,174
Since you're too sick
to work in the clinic--

280
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:39,682
Okay.

281
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:42,151
I thought you--

282
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:47,724
I thought
you could do some teaching.
Patient histories.

283
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,988
My specialty.

284
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:52,462
When you teach,
you learn so much.
Don't you think?

285
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:55,022
It's all about the giving back.

286
00:18:57,703 --> 00:19:01,230
Good old Cuddy.
Always thinking.

287
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,672
She assign you
a patient to interview?

288
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:05,471
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

289
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:08,035
Then why are you still here?

290
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:20,349
Why are we on this case?
'Cause Wilson asked House
to do him a favor.

291
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:23,792
I think House just wants to prove she's sick
so Foreman will be wrong.

292
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:27,025
- Oh, you boys.
- Hey, I'm just doing my job.

293
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,725
Whoa.

294
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:37,641
Foreman's gonna be so embarrassed
when he finds out she's got cancer.

295
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:46,649
Ah. I thought you were
too sick to be down here.

296
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:50,176
I had to get away from those students,
so I faked a page.

297
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:54,885
Foreman's parents,
happily married, 40 years.

298
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,019
Mazel tov.
Kein ayin hara.

299
00:19:57,095 --> 00:20:00,531
So why does he hate
homeless people?

300
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:06,003
I mean, if it's an uncle or a grandparent,
you'd think he'd use it
in his college application essay.

301
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:09,370
Family struggles
beats a 4.0 G.P.A. any day.

302
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:14,037
- I think he had a 4.0.
- Maybe he's just a snob.

303
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:17,047
You really don't need to know
everything about everybody.

304
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:20,050
I don't need to watch The O.C.,
but it makes me happy.

305
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:22,586
Yeah, delirious.
What's the other file?

306
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:28,019
Wilson, James.
Boy Wonder Oncologist.

307
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:29,924
You know him?

308
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:34,762
You know, in some cultures,
it's considered almost rude
for one friend to spy on another.

309
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:40,237
Ofcourse, in Swedish,
the word "friend" can also be
translated as "limping twerp".

310
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:48,677
Did your pager really just go off,
or are you ditching the conversation?

311
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,272
Why can't both be true?
Come on.

312
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:55,845
Solid, noncystic mass
on the left ovary.

313
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,912
Five-by-three centimeters.

314
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,924
Central necrosis.

315
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:03,951
The only question is whether
she dies in two months or three.

316
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:05,963
God.
You were right.

317
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:09,762
There's nothing we can do for her here.
Might as well put her back on the street.

318
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:12,766
Unless it's not cancer.

319
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:15,602
- Ah, you're joking.
- Well, hard not to.

320
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:17,665
Nothing funnier than cancer.

321
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:23,510
What if it's a tuberculoma?
She's living out on the streets,
breathing all kinds of crap 24-7.

322
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:26,449
The odds are, she's got T.B.
Why can't she have
a nice, benign growth to go with it?

323
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:30,454
A solid mass on her ovary.
Ovarian cancer's way more likely.

324
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:34,891
You're right.
It's not even close.

325
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,360
Start her on I.N.H.,
rifampin and streptomycin.

#https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoniazid INH
#https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifampicin
#https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptomycin


326
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:39,989
But that's the treatment
for a tuberculoma.

327
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:43,796
And what is the treatment
for advanced ovarian cancer?

328
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:47,630
Pine box.

329
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:58,146
Oncologist to Nuclear Medicine.
Oncologist to Nuclear Medicine.

330
00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:01,617
What are you giving me?
A second dose
of antibiotics.

331
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:06,181
If you've got a tuberculoma,
it should help.

332
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:09,659
I don't have a tuberculoma, do I?

333
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,529
Probably not.

334
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:24,201
Hey, listen.
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

335
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:28,304
I'm sorry I lied to you.

336
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,474
I took too much insulin on purpose.

337
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,542
I really wanted a place to sleep.

338
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:45,655
Were you ever married, Victoria?

339
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:50,462
But in the comic, it--
Well, it's a comic.
Comics are just made up.

340
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:54,699
So who's James?

341
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:58,209
Is he real, or did you make him up?

342
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:02,510
He's real.

343
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:05,641
Can I help you find him?

344
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:13,080
Oh, the-- the light's bright.

345
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:16,252
It's getting brighter--
Oh-- Ow! Oh !

346
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:18,296
Hey, take it easy.
Everything's fine.

347
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:22,094
Mr. Fury wants to hurt me!
Please help me!

348
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:24,431
Doctor!
Wait, wait, wait.

349
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:27,097
Hold on, hold on.
Please turn off the light!

350
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:29,663
Please! Oh, God!

351
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,676
All right, hold on, Victoria.

352
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:35,042
Hold on. Take it easy.
Everything's fine.

353
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:37,809
- It's burning!
- Everything's fine, Victoria.

354
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:39,748
It's burning!
Hold on.

355
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:42,946
I'm burning!
Take a sip, take a sip.

356
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:46,354
It's poison!
You gave me poison!

357
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,359
Hold on.

358
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,225
Take it easy.

359
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:55,122
Hey, turn off that damn light!

360
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,327
Help me, please!

361
00:23:57,402 --> 00:24:02,806
Take it easy. Take it easy.
The bad guys can't get you here.
I've got you covered.

362
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:05,604
But Mr. Fury's not the bad guy.

363
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:08,669
I'm the bad guy.
It's me. I'm the bad guy.

364
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,854
It's not a tuberculoma.

365
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:18,685
Can't be.

366
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:23,160
I didn't know the biopsy
was back.
Her temperature's 105.

367
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,222
The treatment's not working.
It's cancer.

368
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,289
She's dying.

369
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,997
105.
Good news.

370
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:36,166
It's a tuberculoma.
How do you figure that?
Her temp's through the roof.

371
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:40,268
The lab results from the biopsy.
It's definitely a tuberculoma.

372
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:46,947
So, we're right about the diagnosis,

373
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:50,545
and the treatment for that diagnosis
is killing her.

374
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,951
Perfect.

375
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:57,961
The lab checked the biopsy
again, twice.

376
00:24:58,029 --> 00:25:00,964
Well, a tuberculoma doesn't
give you a temperature of 105.

377
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:03,057
Then it's a tuberculoma
and something else.

378
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:06,297
The "something else"
is gonna melt her brain.
Poach.

379
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,197
Better metaphor.

380
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:12,641
A fever that high
has to be bacterial.

381
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:16,545
- Maybe the bowel got nicked in the biopsy.
- I did the biopsy. No nick.

382
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:20,107
- She could have picked up
an infection on the streets.
- She didn't have a fever when I admitted her.

383
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:24,121
The Prozac we gave her could have
triggered serotonin syndrome,
which would explain the fever.

#https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotoninsyndrom

384
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,885
- No. Jefferson put her on Prozac
and it wasn't a problem.
- She probably never took it!

385
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:30,257
Most likely, they saw her one time
and dumped her out of the E.R.
with a scrip.

386
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:34,890
- Oh, just like you were gonna do!
- Okay, you two. Grab some scalpels
and settle this like doctors.

387
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,893
Send blood and urine cultures
and get a chest X-ray.

388
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:43,066
Fine, take her off the Prozac
and put her on Bromocryptene
for the serotonin syndrome.

389
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:47,840
Might wanna get her in an ice bath as well,
assuming we want her to live long enough
to see those test results.

390
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:54,475
I said I was sorry.

391
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:58,512
Your fever's 105.
If we don't bring it down fast--

392
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,649
Foreman,
why are you doing this to me?

393
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,625
I'm saving your life.

394
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:07,722
No, don't make me go in there, please.
Don't make me do it, please!

395
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:10,359
I don't wanna go!

396
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:12,198
Come on.
You can do this.

397
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:33,888
Please!

398
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:42,299
Seventeen-year-old female
presents with abrasions and
apparent trauma injury to her wrist.

399
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:45,359
Dr. House?
Continue.

400
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:48,405
You're reading a comic book.

401
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:51,965
And you're calling attention to your bosom
by wearing a low-cut top.

402
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:56,747
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought we were having
a "state the obvious" contest.

403
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:58,749
I'm competitive by nature.

404
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:01,752
I thought you were
supposed to be listening to
our patient histories.

405
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:06,257
No, I'm supposed to be teaching you.
If I can do that without listening,
more power to me.

406
00:27:06,324 --> 00:27:07,848
Seventeen-year-old female--

407
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:13,023
If this guy's supposed to have
universal power over all gravity,
how come his hair won't stay down?

408
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:15,032
That's just stupid.

409
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:18,035
- She fell off her horse
while riding in the county fair.
- No, she didn't.

410
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:22,597
She fell off the steps of her beach house.
You must have gone to the wrong room.

411
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:27,407
Hard to believe that one patient
could slip past Cuddy and get herself
admitted with a sprained wrist.

412
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,913
Two seems almost impossible.
What room?

413
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:32,040
Room 2106.

414
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:36,613
Patients lie,
but usually only one lie at a time.

415
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:38,622
How much does she weigh?

416
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:41,682
- It's her wrist, not her weight--
- Poundage, ladies.

417
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,059
- And by-the-by, what color's her nose?
- She's thin.

418
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:47,690
- Flesh tone?
- What does this have to do
with her wrist?

419
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:50,200
Almost nothing.

420
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:54,637
She's either under ninety pounds
or she has a red nose. I gotta go.

421
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:56,731
What's wrong with her?

422
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:59,606
That would be telling.

423
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:02,476
Oh, I am just too nice.

424
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:05,412
It starts with "C".

425
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:11,413
- Urine cultures are negative.
- So is the chest X-ray.

426
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:15,983
- I assume there's a positive coming.
- Lumbar punctures reveal
elevated proteins and white counts.

427
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:18,495
C.S.F. cultures?
Still brewing.

428
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:21,657
Nothing on gram stain.
It looks like meningitis.

429
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:25,066
We know it's definitely an infection,
and we know where it is.

430
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:27,331
Well, meningitis
is nice and simple.

431
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:30,340
Get her in isolation
and start her on Ceftriaxone.

#https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceftriaxon

432
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:32,899
Either she gets better,
or she dies.

433
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,703
Let me know which one happens.

434
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:45,582
Oh, my God!
She was sedated.

435
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:48,353
It must have worn off.
I did it myself a half hour ago.

436
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:50,417
I'll check
the nurse's station.

437
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:53,987
Calendraica.

438
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:13,307
She's gonna die out there.

439
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:19,549
You don't walk out of a room
with 10 milligrams of Haldol
in your system.

440
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:22,559
You don't walk at all.
It was 10 milligrams!
I gave it to her.

441
00:29:22,627 --> 00:29:26,063
It doesn't matter!
Bacterial meningitis--
highly contagious.

442
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:29,464
If she is out of the hospital,
we are so liable.

443
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:32,298
Not to worry. She'll be dead
before she can kill anybody.

444
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:35,771
Security tape confirms it.
She stole some clothes
and she's gone.

445
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:42,604
Wrong coat.
The cape's in the closet.
I had it cleaned.

446
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,774
- Funny.
- You gonna save her?

447
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:48,785
In her comics,
Mr. Fury lives in Sloan Harbor.

448
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:52,118
The night she came in,
she was at a rave at 1408 Sloan Street.

449
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:55,023
You've been reading.
My, how you've changed.

450
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:57,288
You are a doctor.
Do what doctors do.

451
00:29:57,362 --> 00:30:01,822
Pick up the phone, dial 911,
and a cop on the other end
does what cops do...

452
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,460
and finds the missing person.

453
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:08,370
I assume the rest of you
have doctor things to do.
I know you do.

454
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:12,704
- Cacchi-Ricci Disease.
- Do you even know what that is?

#https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markschwammniere Cacchi-Ricci

455
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:15,712
Or are you just guessing
everything that starts with "C"?

456
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:19,341
The kidney problems
could result in weight loss.
Cacchi. C-A-C--

457
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:21,351
Oh, geez,
she's going alphabetically.

458
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:23,979
Doctor, why are you
wearing that bird pin?

459
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:27,014
It sets off my eyes.

460
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:31,160
Hi, Jodi. I'm Dr. House.
What brings you to the hospital?

461
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:33,993
My wrist.
How did that happen?

462
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:38,092
I was riding the Ferris wheel,
and this huge seagull flew right at me.

463
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,034
How horrifying.

464
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:43,039
I swung my arm at the bird,
but I hit the Ferris wheel.

465
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:47,507
She's making it all up?

466
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:50,673
- No, her wrist really does hurt.
- I'm not lying.

467
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:54,844
Ofcourse you are.
You have no idea what happened.
You have no memory.

468
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:00,857
Korsakoff's syndrome.

#https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korsakow-Syndrom

469
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:04,691
Her brain is damaged by
excessive drinking or insufficient diet,
pretty obviously the latter.

470
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:07,526
She has no new memories,
no new ideas.

471
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:09,533
Can't even process that idea.

472
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:12,229
So her brain fills the gaps
as best it can using visual clues.

473
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:15,238
The horse on your shirt
led her to the riding accident,

474
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:18,002
and the surfscene
on your clipboard
led her to the beach.

475
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:20,670
"Korsakoff" doesn't start with a "C".

476
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:23,179
I didn't say "C".

477
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:25,182
Or did I?

478
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:29,914
Lesson to be learned--
treat everybody as if they have Korsakoff's.
We all lie anyway.

479
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:32,286
Give her thiamine right away.
She'll bounce back pretty quickly.

480
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:35,224
And then get her to eat
some cake and ice cream.

481
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:37,557
Yes?

482
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:40,564
Did you need to be so cruel?
I think she's crying.

483
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:49,105
Hi, Jodi. I'm Dr. House.
What happened to your wrist?

484
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:51,368
There was this weird old guy.
He had a cane.

485
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:53,637
See?
It's like it never happened.

486
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:56,578
Perfect forgiveness.

487
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:02,152
Pulse is rapid.
You got a temp?

488
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,984
Don't know. She's warm, but--
Might be something to look into.
She has meningitis.

489
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:07,957
Sorry. I was more worried
about her heart blowing up.
Pulse is 150.

490
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:09,789
Rhythm regular?
Yeah.

491
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:13,126
Ready?
One, two, three.

492
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:15,757
- Where'd you find her?
- Battlefield State Park.

493
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:17,425
She narrow complex?
Uh-huh.

494
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:21,939
- She wasn't at Sloan?
- She was just passed out on the grass.

495
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:24,804
Foreman.
I need Foreman.

496
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:29,377
All right. Supraventricular tachycardia.
Get me adenosine, one milligram, I.V. push.

497
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,438
Right away.
Thank you.

498
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,924
Hang in there.

499
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:47,163
Her arrhythmia's stabilized.

500
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:52,328
Doesn't make sense.
What would push her heart rate
over 150? Dehydration?

501
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:55,099
- Fever?
- Unlikely. By themselves,
neither one would do it.

502
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:57,971
We must be wrong
about the meningitis.
Maybe it's structural heart disease.

503
00:32:58,042 --> 00:33:01,273
Her heart rate dropped
when you administered the adenosine.

504
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:04,179
In two seconds.

505
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:06,478
It's still meningitis.

506
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:10,851
If it is, with the delay in treatment,
she's-- she's got almost no chance.

507
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:13,288
Start the treatment.

508
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:18,128
Read the report.
I found her lying on the grass.

509
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:22,132
You should read my reports.
I make up stuff all the time.

510
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,794
What really happened?

511
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:26,860
Well, since it's you--

512
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:31,500
I found her lying on the grass.

513
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:36,646
Wow.

514
00:33:36,714 --> 00:33:38,841
That is a great-looking gun.

515
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:41,282
It's not a gun.
It's a Taser.

516
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,820
It's so cool-looking.
What does it do?

517
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:46,448
Fire about 60,000 volts?

518
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:49,823
At least that's what it would take
to jack someone's heart up to 150.

519
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:52,328
Okay, okay.

520
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:57,357
Let's just say
I tell you what happened.
It stays between you and me. Right?

521
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:02,070
I found her lying on the grass.

522
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:04,870
Fine.

523
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:07,536
Don't tell me.

524
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:09,842
Tell my friend, Ben Franklin.

525
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:15,250
Dr. Wharton to the research lab.
Dr. Wharton to the research lab.

526
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:19,920
I watch a lot of cop shows.

527
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:28,932
The good news is, the heart rate thing
is not connected to her condition.

528
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:34,366
Well, then she's dying, 'cause
the meningitis treatment isn't helping her.
She's getting worse.

529
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:38,072
Well, that brings us
to the bad news.

530
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:40,770
The cop Tasered her.

531
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:44,872
Jerk. Probably couldn't
get to his real gun fast enough.

532
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:47,747
First time he hit her in the thigh...

533
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,946
and she just kept going,
like it was nothing.

534
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:52,512
Right about here.

535
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:10,263
She didn't feel the Taser.

536
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:20,580
Localized numbness?
Yeah, in that one spot.

537
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:22,744
The diabetes?

538
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,981
I don't think so.

539
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:29,988
Well, no alcohol.
Not entrapment syndrome.

540
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:32,894
Can't be a vitamin deficiency.

541
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,956
We can't chase down
every sensory neuropathy.

542
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:43,038
Is that where she bit you?
Yeah.

543
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,972
What the hell!

544
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:55,285
Can't get angry
if you don't feel anything.

545
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:02,991
First, there's localized numbness,

546
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:07,192
then sensitivity to light,

547
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:09,631
disorientation, paranoia,

548
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:13,363
ineffectiveness of sedatives,
and then hydrophobia.

549
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,830
Fear of water.

550
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:20,576
Rabies.

551
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:24,581
There have only been, what,
10 cases in the last 20 years?

552
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:28,676
Yeah, that's because nonhomeless people,
when they get bitten, they get shots.

553
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:30,345
There were bats.

554
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:47,003
She's dying.

555
00:36:49,073 --> 00:36:51,541
There's no treatment.

556
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,604
How much time does she have?

557
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,614
A day. Maybe two.

558
00:36:57,682 --> 00:37:01,379
And if you don't get your shot
in the next, say, three hours,

559
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:04,717
I'm gonna have to make
another affirmative action hire.

560
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,049
Come on.

561
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:17,196
Do it.

562
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:24,868
You want me to talk to her?

563
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:27,672
And say what?

564
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:32,910
"There's some experimental treatment
that's not gonna work"? No.

565
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:36,653
"But don't worry,
we can make you comfortable"?

566
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:40,122
Doesn't matter.

567
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:43,922
Now she's gonna die in that room.

568
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:45,929
Yeah.

569
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:47,931
That's what you say to her.

570
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:50,832
Keep that there
and rest for a minute.

571
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:54,635
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

572
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:57,265
Tell House I need to go out
for about an hour.

573
00:37:57,341 --> 00:38:00,003
She may not have that long.

574
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:06,406
I don't want her to die alone.

575
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,776
You're going to find James.

576
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:11,913
I'm gonna try.

577
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:26,297
Well, I must say,
he's done a lot with the place.

578
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,635
Hello?

579
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:58,668
Hey.

580
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:00,465
This is it.

581
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:09,773
Man. No one's been in here
for a long time.

582
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:25,118
It's gotta be James.

583
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,521
Maybe there's another address.

584
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,525
That's not James.

585
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:37,803
Paul.

586
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,775
Paul Furia.

587
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:42,537
Mr. Fury.

588
00:39:42,613 --> 00:39:45,878
Her husband.

589
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:48,544
Then who's James?

590
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:56,349
Her kid.

591
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:10,239
Aw, I just wanna eat you up.
You're so delicious!

592
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:14,243
Aw, look at me.

593
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:18,247
You're just like your papa.
Look at you! Just like your dad.

594
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:21,146
Foreman.

595
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:23,482
Foreman?

596
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:28,548
They're dead.

597
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:34,395
That car crash two years ago--

598
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:39,927
She broke her arm,
and they were killed.

599
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:45,303
She was driving.

600
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:13,500
James.

601
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:15,937
No.

602
00:41:16,006 --> 00:41:19,305
It's Paul.
Paul?

603
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:23,410
You've come to take me.

604
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:26,539
No.

605
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:29,709
I've come to forgive you.

606
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:36,626
It wasn't your fault.

607
00:41:41,298 --> 00:41:43,892
I'm so sorry.

608
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:47,062
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

609
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:51,368
I know.

610
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:54,343
It's okay, Victoria.

611
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:56,402
It's okay.

612
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:15,097
Oh.

613
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:17,156
You followed me?

614
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:20,436
No.

615
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:24,600
You were wearing rain boots today,
but you were parked
in the underground garage,

616
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:29,738
so the only reason you'd need boots
was if you were hitting the streets.

617
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:32,008
I followed you.

618
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:35,449
Didn't we have a conversation
about friendship?
Yeah.

619
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:38,283
I had some follow-up questions.

620
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:43,350
I've met your parents
and your brother.

621
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:45,793
I have two brothers.

622
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:51,564
Why wouldn't you tell me--
It wasn't relevant.

623
00:42:51,635 --> 00:42:54,968
Why not?
Because he's not
in my life anymore.

624
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:58,298
Well, that's relevant.

625
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:05,740
This was the last place I saw him.

626
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:07,977
Nine years ago.

627
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:14,924
I don't even know if he's alive.
