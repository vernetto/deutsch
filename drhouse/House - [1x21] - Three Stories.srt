1
00:00:00,967 --> 00:00:02,867
He is not sick.

2
00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:05,666
Dr. Riley is throwing up.
He obviously can't lecture.

3
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:08,731
You witnessed the spew?
Or you just have his word for it?

4
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:12,437
I think I'm coming down
with a little bit of the clap.
I may have to go home for a few days.

5
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,605
Dr. Riley doesn't have a history
of lying to me.

6
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:17,616
You said this is the fifth time
he's missed a class this year.

7
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:21,120
- Either he's dying or he's lying.
- I'll give you two hours off clinic duty.

8
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:24,020
Fine. I'll have Cameron do it.
She loves inspiring the inspired.

9
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,287
- You'll do it.
- Why is it always me?

10
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,295
Because the world hates you.
Or because it's a class on diagnostics.

11
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:32,854
Pick whichever reason
feeds your narcissism better.

12
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:34,957
I'm not doing it.

13
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,111
You're supposed to stop me.
Renegotiate.

14
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:52,413
And you were supposed
to keep on walking.

15
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:55,045
Sorry. Guess we both screwed up.
Go on. Do it again.

16
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:58,819
I'll do the lecture
for four hours off clinic.

17
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:02,123
Two. I know you'd rather
spend a couple of hours...

18
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:04,891
listening to yourself
than listening to patients.

19
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:07,831
Class starts in 20 minutes.

20
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:14,599
- Dr. House, there's a patient.
- I'm outta here. Take it up with Cuddy.

21
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:16,608
Greg.

22
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:24,250
Hi, Stacy.

23
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:26,785
How ya doin'?

24
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:29,413
How am I doing?

25
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:33,353
The last five years have been like--

26
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,190
You ever see those
Girls Gone Wild videos?

27
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:39,823
Your life's been like that?
Or your life's been spent watching them?

28
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,763
I have missed you.

29
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:50,201
Is that why you're here?

30
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:58,211
I need your help.

31
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:10,727
Who am I looking at?
My husband.

32
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:17,962
Who is suffering abdominal pain
and fainting spells.

33
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:21,734
No sign of tumors, no vasculitis.

34
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,572
Could be indigestion.

35
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:29,741
Or maybe a kidney stone.
Little one can pack a lot of wallop.

36
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,716
Did you think I wasn't
going to get married?

37
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:35,618
Not to someone so poorly endowed.

38
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:37,918
This guy's pancreas is pathetic.

39
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:44,828
There is no kidney stone,
no indigestion.

40
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:48,334
Three hospitals, five doctors--
Not one of them found anything.

41
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:50,392
Maybe there's nothing to be found.

42
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:54,031
Right. You suddenly trust doctors,
love puppies and long walks in the rain.

43
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:56,098
Walks are out.

44
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:59,543
I was around you long enough
to know when something's not right.

45
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:03,480
Mark's had personality changes.
He's acting strange, disconnected.

46
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,484
Interesting.

47
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:09,215
Means there's either a neurological
component, or he's having an affair.

48
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,723
No affair. No nothing. He's sick.

49
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:16,257
I know you're not too busy.
You avoid work like the plague.

50
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,923
Unless it actually is the plague.

51
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:22,934
I'm asking you a favor.
I'm not too busy.

52
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:28,064
But I'm not sure I want him to live.

53
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,102
It's good seeing you again.

54
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,491
Three guys walk into a clinic.

55
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:31,264
Their legs hurt.
What's wrong with them?

56
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,707
I'm not gonna like you, am I?

57
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,869
The most likely cause of leg pain
is muscle strain.

58
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,709
Apply heat
and rest affected areas.

59
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,272
Statistically, you're right.
Very good.

60
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,217
My experience, over half of leg pain
is musculoskeletal,

61
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,414
generally from excessive exercise,

62
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:53,357
Twelve percent is varicose veins
brought on by pregnancy,

63
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:56,589
and most of the rest is the result
of vehicular accidents.

64
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:59,632
I said three people.
That's six legs.

65
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:04,329
So you've got three hurt jogging, two
in collisions, and one of the legs is pregnant.

66
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:07,396
What were they doing when pain presented?

67
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:10,931
- I have no idea.
- You didn't ask? You didn't take a history?

68
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:15,310
Ofcourse. But all that told us
is what they said happened.

69
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:19,283
Person "A", farmer,
says he was fixing a fence.

70
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:26,521
Tightness in the ankle,
loss of muscle control.

71
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:29,857
Person "B", volleyball practice.

72
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:37,464
Coach figured it was a pulled muscle.

73
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:41,303
And "C", we've got Carmen Electra golfing.

74
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:46,210
- Yes!
- Whoa. You treated the Baywatch chick?

75
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:50,079
The Baywatch thespian.
And no.

76
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,879
I gotta disguise the identity
of each of the patients,

77
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:55,045
and I got tired
of using the middle-aged man.

78
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:58,420
Carmen seemed like a pleasant alternative.

79
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:00,516
Also, she's apparently quite the golfer.

80
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:04,085
In less than two hours,
one of these three...

81
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:07,690
will be tossed out of the hospital because
they were faking it to score narcotics,

82
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:12,670
and one will be very close to death.

83
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:15,572
Any guesses on which is which?

84
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,840
Okay, I say we start with the farmer.

85
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:24,340
Did you hike to the fence,
and how far?

86
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:28,410
Yes. It's about a half a mile
from my farmhouse.

87
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,422
Where is the pain localized?

88
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,653
It started just above my ankle,
and it's radiating up.

89
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,092
So, what should we do first?

90
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:38,096
Family history?

91
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:40,223
Indicative of leg pain?
That's a very short list.

92
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:45,100
Any history of bone cancer, osteogenesis
imperfecta or multiple myeloma?

93
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:47,071
Could be a blood issue.

94
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,667
We should run a C.B.C.
and a D-Dimer.
And get an M.R.I.

95
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:53,507
M.R.I. or a PET scan?
If the problem's vascular,
he's better off--

96
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:58,346
Sorry. Thanks for playin'.
Patient's dead. You killed him.

97
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,747
We had no time to run any tests.
There was nothing we could do.

98
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:05,382
You had time to look at the leg.

99
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:12,393
I thought we were starting
with the farmer's case first.

100
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:16,697
We are. But if we're
gonna look at a leg--

101
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,828
I need you to take off your pants.

102
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,461
Puncture.

103
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:51,400
Snakebite.
That would be my guess.

104
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,837
Farmer didn't know
he'd been bitten by a snake?
That's what he said.

105
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:57,501
Sudden shooting pain, tall grass.
Never saw a thing.

106
00:07:57,577 --> 00:08:01,741
- What kind of snake?
- You want me to tell you what kind of snake
it was from the shape of the hole in the leg?

107
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,942
How are we to know
what kind of antivenom to use
if we don't know what kind of snake it is?

108
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:07,952
Oh, there are people
to find those things out.

109
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,716
Shouldn't we wait
for the Humane Society or something?

110
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:14,453
Guy might only have a couple of hours.

111
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:23,695
And while we wait
for the Humane Society to show up,

112
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:26,329
what say we check in
on the volleyball player.

113
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:30,167
You have tendinitis.

114
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:32,302
How old is this person?

115
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:36,041
I mean, it's not really a 40-year-old man
on a girls' volleyball team, right?

116
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:38,379
It's a leg.
A leg is a leg is a leg.

117
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:41,852
- Well, I was just worried that--
- Would you worry about her more
if she was younger?

118
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:46,821
Obviously, we should care about all
our patients, no matter what age--

119
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:50,124
Yeah, right. I saw the way
you were looking at Carmen.

120
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,790
She's mine. Stay away.

121
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:57,268
- Would you operate on your mother?
- Ofcourse not.

122
00:08:57,336 --> 00:08:59,896
I'd be too nervous.
Couldn't be objective.

123
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:03,635
Then why are you so anxious
to treat every patient like they're family?

124
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,906
The actual patient is 16.

125
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:09,243
Here's what happens
when doctors care too much.

126
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:12,849
I need to know everything about you.

127
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:16,888
I went back three generations.

128
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:19,686
No history of cancer, Parkinson's
or any other degenerative condition.

129
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,250
But there's this boy at school,
and he's on the boys' volleyball team.

130
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,489
They made out at a party,
and now he won't call her back.

131
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:28,330
And this friend of hers at school
said this boy didn't like her
and never did.

132
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,665
You got all this
from an examination of the knee?

133
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,931
I think she's depressed.
She doesn't have tendinitis?

134
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:35,166
She has tendinitis.
She's depressed
about having tendinitis?

135
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,505
She's depressed for the same
reason that she has tendinitis.
Not the boy?

136
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,740
No, the boy's a jerk. She knows that,
and yet she's depressed.

137
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:42,906
I found a nodule.

138
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:47,146
Ahh. Problems with the thyroid gland--
causes depressed mental state...

139
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:49,517
can cause inflammation
of the tendons.

140
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,057
I'll run the tests.

141
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:54,854
So because she took
such an extreme interest,

142
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,418
she found out that the person
had a thyroid condition.

143
00:09:57,496 --> 00:10:01,899
No. Because she took such an interest,
she discovered a tiny nodule...

144
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:06,029
which in reality signified nothing
but gave us no choice...

145
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:10,235
but to put a person with tendinitis
through an expensive and painful test.

146
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:20,046
Here's how a well-adjusted
doctor handles a case.

147
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:30,089
Can I put my pants back on now?
I'd rather you didn't.

148
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:32,653
Which Carmen Electra is this?

149
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:35,098
The first one. The golfer.

150
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:38,261
Then why isn't she wearing pants?

151
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:42,137
You have decreased reflexes
in your patellar tendon.

152
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,506
- Anyone?
- Slipped disc.

153
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:47,410
Could be. How bad does it hurt?

154
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,972
- It hurts really, really bad.
- Yeah?

155
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,280
It doesn't seem real.
Is she the one faking?

156
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:57,846
Oh, for God's sake.
She's here to play into my fantasy,
not 'cause she's Meryl Streep.

157
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,654
Fine.

158
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:05,754
What the hell is wrong with me!

159
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,664
Do something!

160
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:12,500
Too much pain to be a slipped disc.
Could be herniated
and impinging the nerve root.

161
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:14,801
Or it could be referred pain
from his groin.

162
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:18,810
Sir, are you getting pain
anywhere else?

163
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:22,370
- He's curling. It's not the back.
- Sir, where are you getting pain?

164
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:26,111
- Help me!
- He's not gonna tell us anything
if we don't get him out of pain.

165
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:29,518
- Give him 50 milligrams of Demerol.
- We have no history. He could be allergic.

166
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:32,352
- What do I do?
- We can't diagnose him while he screams.

167
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:35,053
Better than killing him
with painkillers. That--

168
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:45,463
Apparently he's not allergic.

169
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:51,140
Thank you. I feel a lot better now.

170
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,714
We screwed up.

171
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:59,717
No. You did exactly
what his attending did.

172
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:02,253
And that was the proper way
to handle the case?
Yeah.

173
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:04,346
The guy used him as a dealer.

174
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:07,221
You're gonna see a lot of drug-seeking
behavior in your practice.

175
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:09,227
There's a reason-- It works.

176
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:13,061
Meanwhile, back on the farm--

177
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,400
Yeah. Timber rattlesnake.

178
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:24,102
Four vials of the CroFab antivenom.

179
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:26,371
- Hey, how ya doin'?
- All right.

180
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:30,905
Thank you. This will start making you
feel better really fast.

181
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:42,191
He's having an allergic reaction. Bag.

182
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,957
Paddles and epi.

183
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:48,363
His heart's fine.
It's not gonna stay that way.

184
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,597
Paddles!

185
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:00,403
What say we take five,

186
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:03,243
get some coffee, go pee.

187
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:14,918
You didn't think
she was gonna get married?

188
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,554
She asked me the same question.

189
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:23,196
And... what?
You're not gonna treat him?

190
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:28,331
There's probably nothing wrong with him.

191
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:32,002
Oh, sure, that makes sense.
She's just using the old
sick husband routine...

192
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:34,443
as an excuse to get
back in touch with you.

193
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:36,981
You think this is easy for her?

194
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:39,984
The only reason she'd be anywhere
near you is if she was desperate.

195
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:42,680
So I should help her
because she hates me?

196
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:45,883
She doesn't hate you.
She loves you.

197
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:51,692
She just... can't stand
to be around you.

198
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,367
Uh, Dr. House?

199
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:58,960
It's been almost six minutes.

200
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:08,846
Found him.

201
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:12,240
The volleyball player...

202
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:19,221
was responding to the anti-inflammatories
as you'd expect in a case of tendinitis.

203
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,987
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What about the snakebite guy?

204
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,427
I don't really care
about the volleyball player.

205
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:27,761
What if I told you the volleyball player
had a sudden massive stroke?

206
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,666
- Really?
- No.

207
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:34,365
But that would make you interested, right?
What if her T-4 came back low?

208
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,603
It's not quite as interesting,
but it has the benefit of being true.

209
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:40,406
You said the thyroid biopsy
was a wasted test.

210
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:45,576
No, I didn't. I said
she put a person with tendinitis
through an expensive and painful test.

211
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:49,178
Apparently, the patient had tendinitis
and a thyroid condition.

212
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:53,316
We're gonna start you on thyroxine.
It'll make you feel better
and level your moods.

213
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:57,461
Thank you.

214
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:11,039
- So that's it?
- You were right the first time.

215
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:15,604
Snakebite guy's way more interesting.
Gross, actually.

216
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:22,380
The patient responded to epinephrine,
and the allergic reaction was arrested.

217
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:24,979
Unfortunately, the patient
continues to deteriorate.

218
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:27,958
Maybe the snake wrangler
was wrong about the type we caught.

219
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:32,657
He faxed us the venom test.
Confirmed. It's a timber rattlesnake.

220
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:35,564
No, it's not. Notice the volume?

221
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:40,128
I skimmed over that
and the gender and the coloring.
Jumped right to the name of the snake.

222
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:44,938
Two hundred milligrams.
Our guy got bit less than four hours ago.

223
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:48,673
There's no way a snake regenerates
that much venom that quickly.

224
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:51,910
- We're supposed to know how fast
snakes make their venom?
- No.

225
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:56,944
Unless you've got a patient bit by one.
Then it might be helpful.
So what do we do now?

226
00:15:57,022 --> 00:16:01,459
He must have been bitten by a different
snake. We go back and find it.

227
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:04,428
Or you go online, and you find
there's only three poisonous snakes
common in New Jersey:

228
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:06,964
the copperhead, timber rattler
and the coral.

229
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:11,025
Copperhead and timber rattler both respond
to the antivenoms we gave the guy.

230
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:15,335
- So we give him the antivenom
for the other one?
- Is that a question?

231
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:19,309
We can't just blindly give him
another antivenom, especially
after the first one almost killed him.

232
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:22,939
You said only three types of poisonous
snakes commonly found in New Jersey.

233
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:26,212
- Well, what if this is an uncommon one?
- Very good.

234
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,845
- We gotta find the right snake.
- No need.

235
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:32,618
Odds are by the time you get back,
the autopsy results will tell you
what kind of snake it was.

236
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:35,854
- But you said--
- So we do give him the antivenom
for the other one?

237
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:40,558
Again, was that a question?
I asked what you would do.

238
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:43,328
It seems unfair for you to ask me
what you would do.

239
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:46,599
Who gives the guy
the other antivenom?

240
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,833
And who goes looking for the snake?

241
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:55,080
I assume that one choice kills him,
the other one saves him.

242
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:57,980
That's usually the way it works
at the leg-turning-black stage.

243
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:02,009
So half of us killed him,
and half of us saved his life.

244
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:05,887
- Yeah.
- We can't be blamed for--

245
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:10,918
I'm sure this goes against
everything you've been taught,
but right and wrong do exist.

246
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:13,055
Just because you don't know
what the right answer is--

247
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:15,828
maybe there's even no way you
could know what the right answer is--

248
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:18,335
doesn't make your answer right
or even okay.

249
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:22,773
It's much simpler than that.
It's just plain wrong.

250
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:28,913
We gave the guy the antivenom.
What if I'm allergic again?

251
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:31,245
That's why these people are here.

252
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:34,945
If you have a reaction,
we're ready to do whatever's necessary...

253
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,921
to ensure your airways stay open
and your heart keeps beating.

254
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,720
My wife's on her way in.
Can't this wait?

255
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,956
I'm sorry. It can't.

256
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:17,122
It hurts again.
He came back?

257
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:20,256
On average,
drug addicts are stupid.

258
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:24,828
- I'd call the cops.
- Good for you.

259
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:27,736
A lot of doctors wouldn't risk
their careers on a hunch.

260
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:30,434
It's not a hunch.
I mean, I know he wants drugs.

261
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,636
Well, even drug addicts get sick.

262
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:37,410
Actually, for some reason,
they tend to get sick more often
than non-drug addicts.

263
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:42,509
Luckily, you don't
have to play your hunch.

264
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:45,113
There's a faster way.
Actually, there are several.

265
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,351
My preference is urine testing.

266
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:51,260
- But you already know
he has drugs in his system.
- That's not what I'm testing for.

267
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:55,926
We're gonna put this hard rubber tube
up your urethra and into your bladder.

268
00:18:56,001 --> 00:19:00,267
- It may be a little uncomfortable.
- Shouldn't I be getting
some sort of anesthetic?

269
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,807
We're concerned
about allergic reactions today.

270
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:15,683
If the guy can handle a rod in his penis
for half an hour, he's really sick.

271
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:17,813
Or he's really jonesing.

272
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,051
There's easier ways
to get ahold of drugs.

273
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,559
Other hospitals, for example.

274
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:26,990
The volleyball player
is not responding to treatment.

275
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:32,702
At least we think it's not working...

276
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:35,035
on account of the fact
that she's getting worse.

277
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:37,905
- Can you still hear me?
- No.

278
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:39,910
A little!
Not really!

279
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,710
Well, if you can't hear me,
how do you know what I asked?

280
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:47,149
- Ow!
- I'm sorry. What did I do?

281
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:51,485
I don't know.
It really hurts.
I promise to be very careful.

282
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:54,219
- Susan--
- Not her real name.

283
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:58,093
Susan, I barely touched you.

284
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:02,224
It hurts so much!
I'm sorry. I have to get
this blood. Just hold on.

285
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,064
Hypersensitivity to touch.

286
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:06,661
- Her calcium up?
- Lab over 16.

287
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:10,401
- Question is why. Likely suspects.
- Parathyroid adenoma.

288
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:12,568
- Kidney problems.
- Vit "D" intoxication.
- Hyperthyroid.

289
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:14,202
- Caused by our treatment?
- Whoa, whoa.

290
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,940
Can you please slow down?

291
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:23,715
The adenoma is most likely.

292
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:27,122
Check her P.T.H., phosphorus...

293
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:29,854
and ionized calcium.

294
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:32,123
And do a technetium sestamibi.

295
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:35,860
Okay, that's enough
about the volleyball player.

296
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:39,233
- What's up with the farmer?
- What farmer?

297
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:41,204
Snakebite guy.

298
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:44,037
Oh, right. You guys
don't know about him.

299
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:47,875
He doesn't get bitten until three months
after we treat the volleyball player.

300
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:51,245
Luckily, it's been well established
that time is not a fixed construct.

301
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:54,752
His condition is not improving.
Double the dosage.

302
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,152
- Already did.
- There's another antivenom.

303
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:59,281
- It's not as effective, but--
- Already tried it.

304
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:02,384
- The first stuff, the stuff he was allergic to.
- Gave it to him with high-dose steroids.

305
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:05,487
- Nothing's working.
- What does it all mean?

306
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:09,330
- Wrong snake?
- We tried every other antivenom we had.

307
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:13,804
- We're too late?
- Yep. He's dying. His wife's here.

308
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:17,603
Finally found a babysitter.
Who wants to let 'em know?

309
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:21,778
- Actually, I'm kidding.
- He's not dying?

310
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:25,146
Oh, yeah, he's dying.
But there's no wife and kid.

311
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:27,151
Which is great.

312
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:31,178
Makes the breaking-the-news
thing way easier.

313
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:33,622
Oh, yeah.
One more piece of news.

314
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:43,196
The drug addict is peeing blood.

315
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:50,875
How do they teach you how
to tell someone that they're dying?

316
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:59,443
It's kind of like teaching architects
how to explain why their building fell down.

317
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:01,748
Do you role-play and stuff?

318
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:06,257
Yeah. One of us gives the bad news,
and one of us gets the bad news.

319
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:09,817
What do you have to do to get an "A"
in You're Dying 101?

320
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:13,626
They grade you on gentleness
and supportiveness?

321
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:18,193
Is there a scale
for measuring compassion?

322
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,438
This buddy of mine--

323
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,964
I gotta give him 10 bucks
every time someone says thank you.

324
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:28,843
Imagine that.
This guy's so good,

325
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:32,475
people thank him for telling 'em
that they're dying.

326
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,846
Needs brown.

327
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:42,018
I don't get thanked that often.

328
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:43,994
You're dying.

329
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:48,024
In a few hours.

330
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:53,199
There's nothing we can do
except deal with the pain.

331
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:55,671
Well, I need to go home.

332
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:57,675
You're not going home.

333
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:04,510
But my dog.
What will happen to my dog?

334
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:12,489
Her neck looks clean.
No adenoma.

335
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:16,425
Wait, wait, wait. The guy's dying,
and all he cares about is his dog?

336
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:22,723
Any of you guys go the dog route
in your improv sessions?

337
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:29,300
It's a basic truth of the human condition
that everybody lies.

338
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:33,772
The only variable is about what.

339
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:36,109
The great thing about telling
someone they're dying...

340
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:39,446
is that it tends to focus their priorities.

341
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:42,419
You find out what matters to them.

342
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:45,479
What they're willing to die for.

343
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,560
What they're willing to lie for.

344
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:53,189
You must have a neighbor who--
Neighbors don't like him.

345
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:58,600
So the Humane Society will
take him in and find him a home.
No, they won't.

346
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:04,202
Yeah, but maybe my aunt--

347
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,267
It wasn't a snakebite, was it?

348
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,714
I said I don't remember bein' bit.

349
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,307
Sure you do. Just not by a snake.

350
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:18,084
I assume that Cujo bit
one of your neighbors a while back.

351
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:21,592
You tell me that he bit you,
and I gotta report it.

352
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,254
Cujo's got a record.
He gets the chair.

353
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:32,467
The good news is you might just live.
The bad news is your dog's gonna die.

354
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:36,064
Guy risked his life to save this thing?

355
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:41,638
I'll hold him.
You swab the mouth.

356
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:45,274
I think I've got a better grip here.
You go for the mouth.

357
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,944
All right. I'm odds.

358
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:50,487
You serious?
One, two, three!

359
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:52,955
Damn.

360
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:56,255
I don't care if he's scratching
your nads off, you don't let go.

361
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,761
Just do it!

362
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:02,265
I say we let the guy die.

363
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:05,326
- I got his head. Just do it.
- Got it.

364
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:12,942
What would you call that?

365
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:16,174
It's tea-colored, right?

366
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:19,979
The guy we thought
was just after the drugs--

367
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:24,579
What's the differential diagnosis
for urine that's tea-colored?

368
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:27,181
Kidney stone.

369
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:29,853
Kidney stones would cause what?

370
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:32,624
- Blood in urine.
- What color is your pee?

371
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,631
- Yellow.
- What color is your blood?

372
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,724
- Red.
- What colors did I use?

373
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:39,827
Red, yellow and brown.

374
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:42,874
- And brown. What causes brown?
- Waste.

375
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:45,375
- Which means the kidneys
are shutting down. Why?
- Trauma.

376
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:49,072
- None that his history would indicate.
- Could be damage done
by the self-injection of the Demerol.

377
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:51,308
- Treatment?
- Heat and rest--

378
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,715
- Other possible causes?
- Infection.

379
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:56,015
Start him on antibiotics. What else?

380
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:59,523
Come on! Come on!
I-I don't know.

381
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:02,924
You're useless.
But at least you know it.

382
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:05,554
Blood tests show elevated creatine kinase.

383
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,757
- What does that tell you?
- The trauma diagnosis was right.

384
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:10,392
- He takes it easy
for a few days, he'll be fine.
- You sure?

385
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:13,904
- The elevated C.K. rules out infection--
- You know what's worse than useless?

386
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:17,066
Useless and oblivious.

387
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:19,906
What are they missing?

388
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:22,242
It's kind of hard to think
when you're in our face like--

389
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:26,410
Yeah? You think it's gonna be easier
when you got a real patient really dying?

390
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:28,418
What are you missing?

391
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:30,681
Muscle death.

392
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:38,795
- Not your case.
- Nothing wrong with a consult.

393
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:43,630
Dying muscle leaks myoglobin.
It's toxic to the kidneys.

394
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:46,466
Brilliant.

395
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:49,996
M.R.I. his leg.
See what's killing it.

396
00:26:57,015 --> 00:27:00,075
- Why is the girl getting the M.R.I.?
- Because the neck scan revealed nothing,

397
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:04,087
and her doctor's way more obsessive
than she thinks she is.

398
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:07,556
- But you said the guy needed the M.R.I.
- Because Dr. Cameron back there
said muscle death.

399
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:10,925
Not one of you said it.
Not one of this guy's doctors said it.

400
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:15,456
They gave him bed rest and antibiotics,
just like you guys would have.

401
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:18,229
- Did he get better?
- No.

402
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:21,067
- How long--
- Three days.

403
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:25,303
It is in the nature of medicine
that you are gonna screw up.

404
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:27,311
You are gonna kill someone.

405
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:31,645
If you can't handle that reality,
pick another profession.

406
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:35,311
Or finish medical school and teach.

407
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:38,356
Three days before they thought
it might have been muscle death?

408
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:42,917
No, three days before the patient
suggested it might have been muscle death.

409
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:50,429
The M.R.I. revealed an osteosarcoma.

410
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:56,031
A cancerous tumor on your femur.
It needs to be removed surgically.

411
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:58,871
With chemo, she has
an excellent chance of survival.

412
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:04,472
But I have to warn you--
depending on how large the tumor is
and how ingrained it is,

413
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:09,852
the surgeon may need
to amputate your leg.

414
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,681
I'm sorry.

415
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:16,522
It's okay.

416
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,767
Dogs' mouths are pretty filthy,

417
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:27,032
but they have natural antibodies
to fight off most of the stuff.

418
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:29,630
We don't. That's why
dog bites can be so nasty.

419
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:33,542
Lab tests of your dog's saliva
revealed a type of strep bacteria.

420
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:36,774
It's commonly known
as the flesh-eating disease.

421
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:40,306
We need to operate immediately
to remove the damaged tissue.

422
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:43,183
We may need to remove the leg.

423
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:54,527
The M.R.I. revealed a problem.
No kidding.

424
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:57,591
I'm sorry none of your doctors
found it earlier.

425
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:01,765
I am personally gonna oversee
your treatment from now on.
You're gonna cut me open, aren't you?

426
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:06,675
We may need to remove the leg.

427
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:22,791
His M.R.I. showed that the leg pain
wasn't caused by the self-injection.

428
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:25,352
It wasn't caused by an infection.

429
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:30,164
It was an aneurysm that clotted...

430
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:33,466
leading to an infarction.

431
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:36,530
My God, you were right.
It's House.

432
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:40,567
We have to do the surgery.

433
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:43,910
The necrotic tissue has to be removed.
If there's too much--

434
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:46,075
I don't care what you find.

435
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:48,210
It may become necessary
in order to save your life.

436
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,914
I like my leg.

437
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:53,924
I've had it for as long as I can remember.

438
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:58,622
Greg, I love your leg
as much as you do.
They're not cutting it off.

439
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:04,201
The patient made the right choice.

440
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:07,534
Tell a surgeon that
it's okay to cut a leg off,

441
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:10,403
and he's gonna spend the night
polishing his good hacksaw.

442
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:13,740
Right. Surgeons could care less
about saving limbs.

443
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:17,908
Ofcourse they care about their patients.
They just care about themselves more,

444
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,746
which is not an unreasonable position.

445
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,946
Trying to maximize the tissue you save...

446
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:26,081
also maximizes the chances
of something going wrong,

447
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:29,888
which means you've gotta be extra careful,
which is such a pain in the ass.

448
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:35,592
Amazing advances have been made.
Kids with prosthetic legs...

449
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,862
are running the hundred-meter dash
in 12 seconds.

450
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:40,404
Yeah, they're just not as pretty.

451
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:44,573
Do a bypass.
Restore the circulation.

452
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:47,042
- Amputation is safer.
- For you or me?

453
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:50,911
- The blockage of blood flow--
- Four-day blockage.

454
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:53,041
Yes. It caused muscle cell death.

455
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:55,711
When those cells die,
they release cytokines and potassium.

456
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:58,813
And if you restore the blood flow
instead of just lopping it all off,

457
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:01,222
then all that crap gets washed
back into my system.

458
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:05,126
The cytokines could cause organ failure.
The potassium could cause cardiac arrest.

459
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:08,063
On the other hand,
I may just get the use of my leg back.

460
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:12,069
The postoperative pain alone will--
I'll get through it.

461
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:15,902
I understand the risks. You're
in the clear. Go schedule an O.R.

462
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:27,479
- God, you're an idiot.
- I think I'm more of a jerk.

463
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:30,112
I'm not being glib,
and I'm not being cute.

464
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:33,021
I don't want you to kill yourself.

465
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:35,184
I'm not gonna die.

466
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:38,457
Oh, I feel completely reassured.

467
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:09,453
More suction.

468
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:55,505
Inserting now.

469
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:23,463
They gotta up the morphine.

470
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:28,767
- Doctors say they can't.
- Doctors recommended
bed rest and antibiotics.

471
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,207
- They screwed up.
It doesn't mean they're wrong this time.
- Sure doesn't mean they're right.

472
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:34,574
- Morphine will kill you.
- I can handle it.

473
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:38,445
- You're in pain.
You're not thinking right.
- That's why I need the damn morphine!

474
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:41,041
I'll talk to them.

475
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:46,614
Oh, my God. How much longer
is the pain gonna last?

476
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,091
It depends on how much
muscle cell death there was.

477
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,823
He could be right.
He could come out of this
with almost full use of his leg.

478
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:54,125
Or?

479
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:57,133
He could be in pain
for the rest of his life.

480
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:03,731
There's a third option...
surgically.

481
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:06,777
A middle ground between
what we did and amputation.

482
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:13,348
He's not big on middle ground.

483
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:15,682
Yeah.

484
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:43,478
Nurse? Nurse!

485
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:46,608
- I need more calcium gluconate.
- You just had five m.l.'s.

486
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:49,778
The Q.R.S. is getting wider.
My potassium is rising.

487
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:52,049
- I'll talk to your doctor.
- Well, you better make it fast,

488
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:54,148
'cause I'm about to go
into cardiac arrest.

489
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:58,662
You give me the dose, or I go
into wide complex tachycardia.

490
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:00,526
- I could get in trouble--
- Listen, it's not a narcotic!

491
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:03,863
I'm not looking for a buzz.
You got about 20 seconds.

492
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:13,404
I was wrong.

493
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:21,408
What do you got?
Wide complex tachycardia.

494
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:22,919
You diagnosed--
He did.

495
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:24,682
Defibrillator.
Paddles.

496
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,223
Charge.
Clear.

497
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:36,191
The patient was technically dead
for over a minute.

498
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:12,660
He's back.

499
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:21,443
Do you think he was dead?

500
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,309
Do you think
those experiences were real?

501
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:29,619
Define "real".
They were real experiences.

502
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:32,918
What they meant--

503
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:36,289
Personally, I choose to believe
that the white light people sometimes see,

504
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,386
the visions this patient saw,

505
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:43,422
they're all just chemical reactions
that take place while the brain shuts down.

506
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:48,665
- You choose to believe that?
- There's no conclusive science.

507
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:52,732
My choice has no practical
relevance to my life.

508
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:55,244
I choose the outcome
I find more comforting.

509
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:58,180
You find it more comforting
to believe that this is it?

510
00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:04,220
I find it more comforting to believe
that this... isn't simply a test.

511
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:12,929
How bad is the pain right now?

512
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:15,966
It's bad.

513
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:19,696
It's not getting any better.
If you were right,
the pain would be subsiding.

514
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:22,568
You'd be getting better.
It's just taking longer.

515
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,608
No, it's not.

516
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:27,542
We've gotta let 'em
cut the leg off.

517
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:34,781
It's my leg. It's my life.

518
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:37,480
Would you give up your leg
to save my life?

519
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:39,682
Ofcourse I would.

520
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,987
Why do you think your life
is worth less than mine?

521
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:47,392
If this were any other patient,
what would you tell them to do?

522
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:55,605
I would say it's their choice.
Not a chance.

523
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:59,666
You'd browbeat them
until they made the choice
you knew was right.

524
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:03,703
You'd shove it in their face
that it's just a damn leg.

525
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:08,180
You don't think you deserve to live?

526
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:11,415
You don't think you deserve to be happy?

527
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:15,882
Now let them cut off your leg.

528
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:21,660
I can't. I can't.

529
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:23,666
I'm sorry.

530
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:34,611
The pain alone is gonna kill you.

531
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:38,080
I know. I know.

532
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:44,721
I need you to talk to the doctor.

533
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:54,864
He change his mind?

534
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:56,593
No.

535
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:01,198
He's asked to be put
in a chemically induced coma...

536
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:04,105
so that he can sleep through
the worst part of the pain.

537
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:08,875
We can do that.

538
00:39:10,247 --> 00:39:13,045
What happens after he's in the coma?

539
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:15,608
We'll obviously monitor
his condition closely,

540
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:19,645
and if he can get through
the next 48 hours without
another cardiac incident--

541
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:24,593
I meant, I'm his health care proxy.
I get to make medical decisions for him
if he's not able to.

542
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,163
You should talk to him
about what he wants to do.

543
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:33,601
I know what he wants.
But if he's out, it's my call, right?

544
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:52,914
You'll be out in less than a minute.

545
00:39:57,661 --> 00:39:59,595
Thank you.

546
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:07,033
- Hey.
- Hey.

547
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:09,004
I'll see you when I wake up.

548
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:14,802
We'll go golfing.

549
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:18,972
I love you.

550
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:22,819
I love you too.

551
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:28,057
I'm sorry.

552
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:34,124
You've got nothing to be sorry about.

553
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:55,843
The middle ground you were talking about--

554
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,388
We go in, take out the dead muscle.

555
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,924
There's still some risk
of reperfusion injury, but--

556
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:03,152
Give me the forms you need signed.

557
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,622
You're saving his life.

558
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:12,601
He won't see it that way.

559
00:41:31,021 --> 00:41:35,151
Because of the extent
of the muscle removed,

560
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:39,390
the utility of the patient's leg
was severely compromised.

561
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:43,263
Because of the time delay
in making the diagnosis,

562
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:46,565
the patient continues
to experience chronic pain.

563
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:55,301
She had no right to do that.

564
00:41:55,379 --> 00:41:57,779
- She had the proxy.
- She knew he didn't want the surgery.

565
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:00,578
- She saved his life.
- We don't know that.
Maybe he would've been fine.

566
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:04,212
- It doesn't matter. It's the patient's call.
- The patient's an idiot.

567
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,256
They usually are.

568
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:12,125
Do you have a buzzer or something?
What time does this class end?

569
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,460
Twenty minutes ago.

570
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:22,270
I'm not doing this again.

571
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:26,275
And this guy is not the world's
greatest dad. Not even ranked.

572
00:42:26,343 --> 00:42:31,076
Who the hell lets their kids
play with lead-based paint?
That's why he's always sick.

573
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:34,640
Find him some plastic cups,
and the class is all his again.

574
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:05,078
Stacy, it's Greg.

575
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:08,846
I've got an opening in my calendar
for 10:00 tomorrow morning.

576
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:11,513
Make sure your husband isn't late.
