1
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,067
Bring It Up
About Six More Feet.

2
00:00:39,134 --> 00:00:42,533
Okay, You Can Go Ahead
And Start Dropping It.

3
00:00:47,967 --> 00:00:49,834
Whoa.

4
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,800
Whoa!

5
00:01:11,466 --> 00:01:12,301
Rico!

6
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:12,966
Class Is Over.

7
00:02:14,737 --> 00:02:16,133
What's Going On?
Who Are You?

8
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,801
I'm A Doctor.

9
00:02:17,866 --> 00:02:19,567
Did You Have A Corneal
Transplant Five Years Ago?

10
00:02:19,634 --> 00:02:20,966
Yes.

11
00:02:21,033 --> 00:02:22,734
Every Other Patient Who Had
A Transplanted Organ

12
00:02:22,801 --> 00:02:24,000
From That Donor
Is Either Dead Or Dying.

13
00:02:24,067 --> 00:02:25,966
You Got A Purse?

14
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,500
I Feel Fine.

15
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:33,000
I Don't Mean To Scare You,
But So Did The Others.

One Living, One Almost Dead.

19
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:12,534
Four Fully Dead.

20
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,801
Nothing In Common
Except Their Donor.

21
00:03:14,866 --> 00:03:16,367
Carl Got A New Heart
And Lung.

22
00:03:16,434 --> 00:03:17,767
Liver Kills Him.

23
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:20,687
Tibalt Got A New Liver,
Lung Killed Him.

24
00:03:20,722 --> 00:03:23,300
Holly Got A New Kidney,
Her Heart Blows Up.

25
00:03:23,367 --> 00:03:25,000
And Frank, The Old Guy
Gasping For Breath Upstairs,

26
00:03:25,067 --> 00:03:28,300
He Got An Intestinal Graft,
His Pancreas Is Failing.

27
00:03:28,335 --> 00:03:29,964
All Within Eight Months
Of Each Other.

28
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:32,300
And In Each Case, Serious
Complications Came On Suddenly

29
00:03:32,367 --> 00:03:33,296
And Without Warning.

30
00:03:33,331 --> 00:03:34,577
Which Means Arrhythmia,

31
00:03:34,612 --> 00:03:36,999
Massive Pulmonary Embolus,
Or Cerebral Bleed.

32
00:03:37,034 --> 00:03:39,167
What Did Wilson Do
For Me?

33
00:03:42,267 --> 00:03:43,765
If The Donor Had

34
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,534
An Infection That Somehow
Slipped By A Screening,

35
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,933
It Could Lay Dormant-

36
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,150
Five Organ Systems Hit.

37
00:03:48,185 --> 00:03:49,265
Would Need Five Infections

38
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,168
For It To Somehow Slip
By Screening.

39
00:03:51,233 --> 00:03:53,400
Oh, Sure, He Made Me Laugh
On A Rainy Day,

40
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:56,267
Made Me See The Colors
I Never Knew-

41
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:57,767
None Of The Donated Organs
Were Hit.

42
00:03:57,834 --> 00:03:59,400
It Means Whatever They Got
Came From The Donor's Blood.

43
00:03:59,467 --> 00:04:00,534
That Wouldn't Help Us Narrow
Down What-

44
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,634
It Narrows Down Who.

45
00:04:01,701 --> 00:04:02,867
Corneal Transplants
Are Bloodless.

46
00:04:02,934 --> 00:04:04,267
It Means
Apple's Gonna Be Fine.

47
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,500
You Secure Enough
In That Theory To Send Her Home?

48
00:04:06,567 --> 00:04:08,667
I Guess We Could Wait
Till We Figure Out

49
00:04:08,734 --> 00:04:09,667
What's Wrong With Frank.

50
00:04:09,734 --> 00:04:11,600
On The Other Hand,

51
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:13,300
Gilbert Gottfried
Makes Me Laugh.

52
00:04:13,367 --> 00:04:15,001
And How Many Colors
Are There Really?

53
00:04:15,068 --> 00:04:17,068
Once You Got Red, Blue,
And Green-

54
00:04:17,134 --> 00:04:18,941
He Paid For Your Lunch,
Liked Monster Trucks,

55
00:04:18,976 --> 00:04:19,738
And Was Your Conscience.

56
00:04:19,773 --> 00:04:20,640
Autoimmune Disease.

57
00:04:20,675 --> 00:04:22,567
A.N.A. At Autopsy
Of All Four Victims Were Normal.

58
00:04:22,634 --> 00:04:24,400
Wouldn't Cover Vasculitis.

59
00:04:24,467 --> 00:04:25,218
Henoch-Schonlein Purpura-

60
00:04:25,253 --> 00:04:27,400
Antiphospholipid Antibodies,
Normal.

61
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:28,634
Then That Leaves Cancer.

62
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:30,701
Cancers Have Names.
They Have A Progression.

63
00:04:30,767 --> 00:04:32,367
They Affect
Specific Organs.

64
00:04:32,434 --> 00:04:34,300
Bone Cancer Can't Turn
Into Liver Cancer.

65
00:04:34,367 --> 00:04:35,534
Forget Cancer.

66
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,600
It's Cancer.

67
00:04:38,667 --> 00:04:40,034
It's Not Cancer.

68
00:04:40,101 --> 00:04:41,667
You're Right,
Of Course.

69
00:04:41,734 --> 00:04:43,034
What Was I Thinking?

70
00:04:43,101 --> 00:04:45,034
No Single Type Of Cancer
Blew Up Three Organs

71
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:46,200
In The Chest
While Also Herniating

72
00:04:46,267 --> 00:04:47,168
In The Fighter's Brain Stem.

73
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:48,200
The Fighter's Irrelevant.

74
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:49,567
You Don't Like Coincidences.

75
00:04:49,634 --> 00:04:51,901
It Would Be A Coincidence
If Six Transplant Recipients

76
00:04:51,967 --> 00:04:53,134
Had Nothing Else Wrong
With Them-

77
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,467
Like Being An Idiot,
Which Leads To Getting

78
00:04:54,534 --> 00:04:55,801
Your Head Knocked Off.

79
00:04:55,867 --> 00:04:57,200
The Others Had Cancer.

80
00:04:57,267 --> 00:04:59,534
Four Autopsies
And About 1,000 Lab Tests Say

81
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,801
It's Not Cancer.

82
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:02,867
Redo The Thousand Tests
And The Four Autopsies.

83
00:05:02,934 --> 00:05:04,767
Taub And Kutner,
Check Out The Donor.

84
00:05:04,834 --> 00:05:06,467
Find Out Which Cancer-
He Didn't Die Of Cancer.

85
00:05:06,534 --> 00:05:07,667
His Head Got Chopped Off

86
00:05:07,734 --> 00:05:09,168
In An Industrial Accident.

87
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:10,867
Find Out Which Cancer
Would Have Killed Him.

88
00:05:10,934 --> 00:05:13,068
Check The Home And Office
For Carcinogens, Toxins-

89
00:05:13,134 --> 00:05:14,500
He's Been Dead
For Four Years.

90
00:05:14,567 --> 00:05:16,400
I Assume His Home's Been Rented
To Someone Else By Now.

91
00:05:16,467 --> 00:05:18,701
Find Out Which Cancer
Killed Them.

92
00:05:20,101 --> 00:05:22,634
Did I Forget You?

93
00:05:22,701 --> 00:05:24,701
You Can Check Out
The Patient's Eye.

94
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,101
Put This On Dr. O'shea.

95
00:05:38,168 --> 00:05:41,101
And Some Chips.

96
00:05:41,168 --> 00:05:42,200
Forget Your Wallet,
House?

97
00:05:42,267 --> 00:05:44,503
No.

98
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:48,237
I'll Take Care Of It.

99
00:05:48,801 --> 00:05:50,701
Check.

100
00:05:52,347 --> 00:05:53,934
Are You Following Me?

101
00:05:54,001 --> 00:05:58,300
Word Is You're
Into Monster Trucks.

102
00:05:58,367 --> 00:06:00,667
My Kids Like It.
But Not You?

103
00:06:00,734 --> 00:06:02,068
Predator's Okay,

104
00:06:02,134 --> 00:06:04,175
But I Think The California
Crusher Is Overrated.

105
00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:13,472
Are You Checking Me Out?

106
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:14,550
You're Astute.

107
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,767
No. How Many Pills Did You Just Take?

108
00:06:17,834 --> 00:06:21,600
Vicodin, Opioids,
Some B12.

109
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:23,667
Need A Little Kick
In The Afternoon.

110
00:06:23,734 --> 00:06:25,363
You Got A Problem
With That?

111
00:06:26,801 --> 00:06:28,701
I Think
I'm Falling In Love.

112
00:06:28,767 --> 00:06:29,967
Her Right Eye's Failing.

113
00:06:30,034 --> 00:06:31,867
No, It's Not.

114
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:34,034
Everyone Else's
Transplanted Organs Were Fine.

115
00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:35,068
It Means Her Eye
Is Fine.

116
00:06:35,134 --> 00:06:36,101
We Need To Remove
The Eye.

117
00:06:36,168 --> 00:06:38,767
It's Her Only Working Eye.

118
00:06:38,834 --> 00:06:40,701
We Could Remove The Other One,
But Since It's Not Killing Her,

119
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:42,409
I Thought This Way
Was Less Insane.

120
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,467
Do You Have
Some Ethical Problem

121
00:06:46,534 --> 00:06:47,767
With What I'm Doing
That You Could Express

122
00:06:47,834 --> 00:06:49,701
In A Unique Way
Which Might Actually Make Me

123
00:06:49,767 --> 00:06:52,238
Think That I'm Wrong
Even Though I'll Never Admit It?

124
00:06:52,273 --> 00:06:53,112
Yes.

125
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:55,628
You Are Funny.

126
00:06:56,565 --> 00:06:58,233
The Problem's Not In Her Eye.
It's In Her Head.

127
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,034
You Wanna Come Over
And Watch Prescription Passion

128
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:02,233
At My Place Tonight?

129
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,467
You Know
I'm Not Gay, Right?

130
00:07:03,534 --> 00:07:05,434
Neither Am I.

131
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,400
If You Don't Want To Have Sex,
That's Cool With Me.

132
00:07:07,467 --> 00:07:08,734
I'm Not Coming Over
To Your Home.

133
00:07:08,801 --> 00:07:10,534
I'll Grow On You.

134
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:18,901
L... P... E...

135
00:07:18,967 --> 00:07:20,567
Do I Have To Be
In The Same Room As Him?

136
00:07:20,634 --> 00:07:22,500
Whatever He's Got,
You've Got.

137
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:23,767
Fifth Line.

138
00:07:23,834 --> 00:07:24,834
Are You Sure?

139
00:07:24,901 --> 00:07:26,001
Pretty Sure.

140
00:07:26,068 --> 00:07:27,675
Fifth Line.

141
00:07:31,128 --> 00:07:32,640
Am I Gonna Die?

142
00:07:32,675 --> 00:07:34,934
Can We Talk About Something
Besides You For A Moment?

143
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:37,425
Like Maybe The Fifth Line?

144
00:07:38,934 --> 00:07:42,800
F... E... O... S... P.

145
00:07:44,934 --> 00:07:46,200
Damn.

146
00:07:46,267 --> 00:07:47,467
I'm Sorry.

147
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:48,734
We Need To Remove
Your Eye.

148
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,134
My Eye?

149
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,168
A Moment Ago,
You Thought You Were Dying.

150
00:07:52,233 --> 00:07:54,400
Blind's Actually Good News.

151
00:07:54,467 --> 00:07:56,134
Unfortunately,
He's Wrong.

152
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,534
You Just Did The Test.

153
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,901
She Didn't Squint.

154
00:07:58,967 --> 00:08:00,333
Which Means The Eye Thinks
It's Fine.

155
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,434
It Was Wrong. I Know.
The Eye Doesn't Think.

156
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,634
The Brain Thinks, Which Means
If The Thinking's Wrong,

157
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:05,734
The Brain's Wrong.

158
00:08:05,801 --> 00:08:07,267
Which Means It's Spread
To The Brain,

159
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:10,168
Which Means It's Too Late
For Us To Remove The Eye.

160
00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:14,734
Which Means We're Gonna Have
To Remove Your Whole Head.

161
00:08:14,801 --> 00:08:18,300
Don't Worry.
It Doesn't Hurt.

162
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:25,316
&&&

163
00:08:25,316 --> 00:08:27,159
???

164
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,675
500 Different Things
Can Cause Hallucination.

165
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,474
Doesn't Mean
It's Neurological.

166
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,274
It Does If One Of
The Other Organ Recipients

167
00:08:34,341 --> 00:08:35,942
Also Had A Brain Issue.

168
00:08:36,237 --> 00:08:39,374
Did He Just Drop
Had Brain Issues. Hands?Them

169
00:08:39,441 --> 00:08:41,174
If His Pupils Dilated,

170
00:08:41,241 --> 00:08:42,908
If His Pupils Were Fixed,
If There Was A Twitch...

171
00:08:42,975 --> 00:08:43,841
He Got Hit In The Head,

172
00:08:43,908 --> 00:08:45,575
He Died,
No Mystery.

173
00:08:45,641 --> 00:08:46,708
That Was Your Point.

174
00:08:46,775 --> 00:08:47,975
Yesterday.

175
00:08:48,042 --> 00:08:48,908
You Live,
You Learn.

176
00:08:48,975 --> 00:08:50,541
Who Shot This?

177
00:08:50,608 --> 00:08:52,107
Guy Who Runs The Gym
Has A Camera.

178
00:08:52,174 --> 00:08:54,841
Uploads The Nasty Stuff
Online.

179
00:08:54,908 --> 00:08:57,741
Can't See
The Dead Guy's Face.

180
00:08:57,808 --> 00:09:00,942
I Can't See His Face,
Can't See The Twitch,

181
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:02,328
Can't See The Pupils-

182
00:09:02,363 --> 00:09:04,174
We Know The Tennis Player
Had A Heart Problem.

183
00:09:04,241 --> 00:09:07,942
We Can Maybe Tie That
To The Tuba Player's Lungs,

184
00:09:08,008 --> 00:09:09,107
And Then Somehow Tie
Both Those Things,

185
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:10,541
To The Construction Worker's
Liver,

186
00:09:10,608 --> 00:09:11,841
And Then Possibly Meander

187
00:09:11,908 --> 00:09:13,508
Over To Frank's
Pancreatic Failure,

188
00:09:13,575 --> 00:09:17,341
But Nothing Causes Simultaneous
Brain And Heart Problems.

189
00:09:17,408 --> 00:09:18,775
Cancer Made No Sense.

190
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:21,141
The Head And Heart
Make Less Than No Sense.

191
00:09:21,207 --> 00:09:22,008
That Makes No Sense.

192
00:09:22,074 --> 00:09:23,241
Um.

193
00:09:23,308 --> 00:09:26,641
I Know.

194
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,575
I Was Making
A Point.

195
00:09:28,641 --> 00:09:31,474
Oh, Good.
I Thought You Were An Idiot.

196
00:09:32,285 --> 00:09:34,608
Why Are You Talking?

197
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:39,050
Oh, The Guy Doing Manual Labor
Can't Have An Opinion?

198
00:09:39,942 --> 00:09:42,825
I Might Be A Genius
Who Just Happens To Have

199
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,708
A Passion
For Fixing Coffee Machines.

200
00:09:45,775 --> 00:09:47,608
No, I'm Obviously Not,
But That's Rude

201
00:09:47,675 --> 00:09:48,808
To Make Assumptions
About People.

202
00:09:50,975 --> 00:09:51,908
Donor's History Came Up Clean.

203
00:09:54,841 --> 00:09:56,141
Did He Just Laugh?

204
00:09:56,207 --> 00:09:57,575
No, No, I Sneezed.

205
00:09:57,641 --> 00:09:59,841
He's A Genius Coffee Repairman.

206
00:09:59,908 --> 00:10:02,238
Coffee Repairman
Who Wears Argyle Socks?

207
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,841
I Thought I Already Talked
About Not Judging.

208
00:10:07,508 --> 00:10:09,775
What Kind Of Idiot
Wears Argyle Socks

209
00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:11,975
With Construction Boots?

210
00:10:12,042 --> 00:10:13,374
Uh, I'm Not An Idiot.

211
00:10:13,441 --> 00:10:17,241
I'm Just-I'm Not Good
At Disguises.

212
00:10:17,308 --> 00:10:19,308
Who Is He?

213
00:10:19,374 --> 00:10:22,308
He's Apparently A Very Bad
Private Investigator.

214
00:10:22,374 --> 00:10:24,608
Uh, Why Is He Pretending
To Fix The Coffee Machine?

215
00:10:24,675 --> 00:10:27,107
Because I Wanted To Find Out
What You Guys Found Out

216
00:10:27,174 --> 00:10:29,008
Before I Find Out
What He Found Out.

217
00:10:29,074 --> 00:10:32,174
So I Can Find Out If I Need
A Private Investigator.

218
00:10:32,241 --> 00:10:34,008
So, Nu?

219
00:10:34,074 --> 00:10:35,775
There's No History
Of Unusual Infections,

220
00:10:35,841 --> 00:10:38,503
No International Travel
In The 12 Months-

221
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:44,175
No, Seriously,
That's How I Sneeze.

222
00:10:45,975 --> 00:10:48,474
He Was In Madrid
And The Bahamas.

223
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:50,374
Credit Card Receipts
Showed No-

224
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,474
Girlfriend Paid.
There Is No Girlfriend.

225
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,274
She Was
His High School Sweetheart.

226
00:10:54,341 --> 00:10:55,808
High School Sweetheart
Is Married To His Best Friend.

227
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:56,452
I Know.
Shh.

228
00:10:56,487 --> 00:10:59,141
She Had A Kid Four Years Ago.

229
00:10:59,207 --> 00:11:00,441
Timing Fits.

230
00:11:00,508 --> 00:11:01,441
She's Still Pretty Hot
Though.

231
00:11:01,508 --> 00:11:02,708
You Find Out Anything
Medical?

232
00:11:02,775 --> 00:11:04,141
The Kid Has A Tummy Ache.

233
00:11:04,207 --> 00:11:08,575
Also, The Dead Guy Was Exposed
To Mercury, Mold,

234
00:11:08,641 --> 00:11:10,474
And Hydrous Perchloric Acid

235
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,241
Because Their Sex Pad
Was Next To A Garage

236
00:11:12,308 --> 00:11:14,308
That Was Demolished
After Those Toxins Were Found.

237
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:16,174
Oh, Yeah,
That Will Be

238
00:11:16,241 --> 00:11:18,975
$2,300.

239
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:21,741
I'll Get You
A Check.

240
00:11:21,808 --> 00:11:23,141
No, I Don't Take Checks.

241
00:11:23,207 --> 00:11:24,975
You Think
I'm Gonna Stop Payment?

242
00:11:25,042 --> 00:11:26,841
Aren't You?
Of Course, I Am.

243
00:11:26,908 --> 00:11:28,975
$2,300.
That's Insane.

244
00:11:29,042 --> 00:11:31,341
Actually, That Price Includes
Footage Of The Boxing Match

245
00:11:31,408 --> 00:11:32,708
From Four Different Angles.

246
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,474
30% Of The Crowd
Paid By Credit Card.

247
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:35,775
I Got Their Names.

248
00:11:35,841 --> 00:11:37,074
Four Of Them Had
Digital Cameras,

249
00:11:37,141 --> 00:11:38,608
Which I Composited
Like Nasa Did

250
00:11:38,675 --> 00:11:39,942
For The Pics Of Mars.

251
00:11:40,008 --> 00:11:41,474
You Know, The Rovers
And All That.

252
00:11:45,741 --> 00:11:48,042
Pupils Were Dilated.

253
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:49,341
But He Didn't Drop His Hands,

254
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:50,641
Which Means He Maintained
Muscle Tensity-

255
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,141
Say It.

256
00:11:52,207 --> 00:11:53,741
You Were Right.

257
00:11:53,808 --> 00:11:55,241
God, That Was Petty
Of Me.

258
00:11:55,308 --> 00:11:56,541
He Maintained Muscle Tensity,

259
00:11:56,608 --> 00:11:58,308
But Was Momentarily Distracted
When He Got Hit.

260
00:11:58,374 --> 00:11:59,641
That's A Temporal Lobe Seizure.

261
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,341
Does That P.I. Guy Mean
We Don't Have To Break

262
00:12:01,408 --> 00:12:02,641
Into People's Homes Anymore?

263
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,408
It's The Whole Reason
You Went To Medical School.

264
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:05,608
I'm Not Gonna Take That
Away From You.

265
00:12:05,675 --> 00:12:06,875
He's Better
Than We Are.

266
00:12:06,942 --> 00:12:08,741
And Costs More.
Gonna Biopsy The Brain.

267
00:12:08,808 --> 00:12:10,341
No.

268
00:12:10,408 --> 00:12:11,408
Say It.

269
00:12:11,474 --> 00:12:13,074
You Were Right,
But No.

270
00:12:13,141 --> 00:12:15,908
Temporal Lobe
Controls Speech,

271
00:12:15,975 --> 00:12:16,942
Hearing, Memory.

272
00:12:17,008 --> 00:12:19,074
She Loses Those Things,

273
00:12:19,141 --> 00:12:19,975
She's Gonna Be
A Terrific Date,

274
00:12:20,042 --> 00:12:20,827
But Beyond That-

275
00:12:20,862 --> 00:12:22,808
We Cut Out A Piece Of It,
Good Chance She's A Vegetable.

276
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,207
Nothing To Hear,
Nothing To Say,

277
00:12:24,274 --> 00:12:25,308
Nothing To Look Back On.

278
00:12:25,374 --> 00:12:26,942
You're Right.

279
00:12:27,008 --> 00:12:28,675
She Has So Much
To Live For.

280
00:12:28,741 --> 00:12:31,641
Do We Have Another Patient
Who's Almost Finished

281
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,078
With All Their Living?

282
00:12:33,113 --> 00:12:35,207
So It's Okay To Stab His Brain
Because He's Old?

283
00:12:35,274 --> 00:12:37,341
No, It's Okay To Stab
His Brain

284
00:12:37,408 --> 00:12:39,107
Because He's Dead
If You Don't.

285
00:12:39,174 --> 00:12:41,363
Get The Widow
To Say Yes.

286
00:12:43,274 --> 00:12:44,374
No.

287
00:12:44,441 --> 00:12:45,808
The Lung Inflammation Is
A Complication

288
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,074
Of The Pancreatic Failure,

289
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,875
Which Is Reversible.

290
00:12:48,942 --> 00:12:50,408
This Is Actually
His Best Chance.

291
00:12:50,474 --> 00:12:51,703
If We Can Find Out
What's Wrong...

292
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:53,775
How Can A Test
That Will Probably Kill Him-

293
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:54,841
I Didn't Say-

294
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:56,308
You Said
It Was Extremely Risky.

295
00:12:56,374 --> 00:12:57,274
What Does Extremely Mean?

296
00:12:57,341 --> 00:12:58,738
Please.

297
00:13:00,808 --> 00:13:03,541
I'm Sorry.
I Can't.

298
00:13:03,608 --> 00:13:05,174
I Have A Husband.

299
00:13:05,241 --> 00:13:06,808
I Have A Two-Year-Old
Daughter.

300
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,274
Her Name Is Julia.

301
00:13:08,341 --> 00:13:10,113
You'd Be Saving
Her Mother.

302
00:13:11,775 --> 00:13:13,708
I Think You're Lying.

303
00:13:13,775 --> 00:13:15,765
You Haven't Had One Visitor.

304
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,550
Not One Phone Call
Since You've Been Here.

305
00:13:17,585 --> 00:13:19,575
Does She Have A Child?

306
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:23,964
No.

307
00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:25,644
But Her Life
Is Still Worth-

308
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:26,741
More Than My Husband's?

309
00:13:26,808 --> 00:13:28,608
I Lied To Save My Life.
Wouldn't You?

310
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:30,741
Not At Another Human Being's
Expense.

311
00:13:30,808 --> 00:13:31,741
No, You'd Just Rob Me
Of My Only Chance

312
00:13:31,808 --> 00:13:32,841
So Your Husband Can Struggle

313
00:13:32,908 --> 00:13:33,975
To Breathe
For A Few More Days.

314
00:13:34,042 --> 00:13:35,308
Just Shut Up.

315
00:13:35,374 --> 00:13:37,107
I Don't Want To Hear From You. Ladies.

316
00:13:37,174 --> 00:13:38,575
You Want To Hate Me So You
Won't Feel Guilty. Shut Up!

317
00:13:38,641 --> 00:13:39,808
Frank?

318
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,141
Give Me A Scalpel.

319
00:13:41,207 --> 00:13:42,608
Frank.

320
00:13:47,274 --> 00:13:48,575
Charge.

321
00:13:57,975 --> 00:13:59,174
He's Coding.

322
00:14:00,975 --> 00:14:01,908
Clear.

323
00:14:03,274 --> 00:14:06,008
Clear.

324
00:14:06,074 --> 00:14:07,174
Frank!

325
00:14:07,241 --> 00:14:09,374
Clear.

326
00:14:09,441 --> 00:14:12,141
Clear.

327
00:14:21,074 --> 00:14:22,374
Did You Get
The Consent?

328
00:14:22,441 --> 00:14:23,942
No.
Tell Foreman To Get It.

329
00:14:24,008 --> 00:14:25,875
Old People Are Scared
Of Black People.

330
00:14:25,942 --> 00:14:27,641
It Won't Matter.
Patient's Dead.

331
00:14:30,641 --> 00:14:32,808
Sa The Brain.

332
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,875
Don't Need Consent
For An Autopsy.

333
00:14:57,675 --> 00:15:01,519
Well, At Best, We're Gonna Bat
One For Six On This One.

334
00:15:01,554 --> 00:15:02,837
Thin Slices
Through The Parietal

335
00:15:02,872 --> 00:15:04,120
And Temporal Lobes
Were Clean.

336
00:15:04,187 --> 00:15:06,519
Occipital And
Frontotemporal Regions

337
00:15:06,554 --> 00:15:06,765
Were Also-

338
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,054
Brain's Clean.
Moving On.

339
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,843
To Where?

340
00:15:09,878 --> 00:15:12,420
We've Gone From Making No Sense,
To Making Less Sense,

341
00:15:12,487 --> 00:15:13,821
And Then Taken
A Step Backwards.

342
00:15:13,887 --> 00:15:16,253
Each Of These People
Were Killed By One Thing

343
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,054
That Attacked One Organ.

344
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,621
But Never The Same Organ.

345
00:15:19,687 --> 00:15:21,054
Could The Donor Have Had
Two Things Wrong?

346
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,587
Or Six Things Wrong?

347
00:15:22,654 --> 00:15:25,988
Metabolic Diseases Specialize.

348
00:15:26,054 --> 00:15:27,454
Everything Else Specializes,

349
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,520
But Cancer Plays
The Field.

350
00:15:28,587 --> 00:15:29,887
You're Back To Cancer?

351
00:15:29,954 --> 00:15:32,654
Metastasis Is Just A Fancy Word
For Screws Around.

352
00:15:32,721 --> 00:15:34,054
Any Type Of Cancer?

353
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,354
I Don't Know.

354
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,621
There Would Be Evidence
Of Cancer.

355
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:38,554
There Is.
We Just Haven't Found It Yet.

356
00:15:38,621 --> 00:15:40,021
You Need It To Be Cancer
So You Have An Excuse

357
00:15:40,088 --> 00:15:41,187
To Talk To Wilson.

358
00:15:41,253 --> 00:15:42,454
Give Me Something Else

359
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,821
That Explains This Constellation
Of Patients,

360
00:15:44,887 --> 00:15:45,921
Then You Can Call Me
An Ass.

361
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:47,120
I Didn't Call You An Ass.

362
00:15:47,187 --> 00:15:49,654
Perforated Intestine.

363
00:15:49,721 --> 00:15:51,187
If This Thing Started
As Normal Bacteria

364
00:15:51,253 --> 00:15:52,787
Living In The Intestines

365
00:15:52,854 --> 00:15:54,387
But Got Into A Blood Vessel

366
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,887
Through A Vascular Anomaly
In The Bowel Wall,

367
00:15:56,954 --> 00:15:59,320
Then They Would Affect Every
Organ Through The Blood Stream.

368
00:15:59,387 --> 00:16:01,988
It Screws Up Everything.
For Everyone.

369
00:16:03,454 --> 00:16:04,854
Okay.

370
00:16:04,921 --> 00:16:07,863
It's A Long Shot,
It Is Possible I'm An Ass.

371
00:16:08,675 --> 00:16:11,320
Ironically, We Need To Do
A Colonoscopy To Confirm.

372
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,554
We Checked Apple Inside And Out

373
00:16:12,621 --> 00:16:14,420
When She Came In;
She's Clean.

374
00:16:14,487 --> 00:16:15,721
The Anomaly Would Have To Be
Intermittent

375
00:16:15,787 --> 00:16:17,287
Or They All Would Have Died
Within A Day.

376
00:16:17,322 --> 00:16:18,787
She Starts Getting
Abdominal Pain,

377
00:16:18,854 --> 00:16:21,654
Shove A Tube Up Her Rear
Before It Can Get Away.

378
00:16:21,721 --> 00:16:23,021
And Test Anyone Else
With Stomach Pain.

379
00:16:23,088 --> 00:16:24,454
Everyone Else Is Dead.

380
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,854
Not Everyone.

381
00:16:25,921 --> 00:16:27,654
The One Thing The Donor Gave
To Each Of These People

382
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:29,454
Is His Dna.

383
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,821
Anyone Else
Have His Dna?

384
00:16:34,675 --> 00:16:36,054
You Want To Do A Colonoscopy

385
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,320
On A Healthy Four-Year-Old?

386
00:16:37,387 --> 00:16:38,687
She Has A Tummy Ache.

387
00:16:38,754 --> 00:16:40,253
If Kutner's Right,
It's Not A Tummy Ache,

388
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,387
It's A Fatal Brain Or Heart Or
Lung Or Liver Or Pancreas Ache.

389
00:16:45,454 --> 00:16:47,487
I'm Not Gonna Scare The Hell
Out Of The Poor Kid's Mom

390
00:16:47,554 --> 00:16:49,954
Because Of A Long Shot Corollary
To A Long Shot Theory.

391
00:16:50,253 --> 00:16:52,021
Fine

392
00:16:52,088 --> 00:16:54,287
Tell Her The Truth.

393
00:16:54,354 --> 00:16:57,921
Then Ask If Daddy Knows
Who The Real Daddy Is.

394
00:17:11,988 --> 00:17:14,120
Does She Have To Be Awake?

395
00:17:14,187 --> 00:17:17,175
We Need Her To Tell Us
When It Hurts.

396
00:17:18,921 --> 00:17:20,253
She'll Get Over It.

397
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:24,021
Your Husband Might Not Have.

398
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:32,354
What If A Kid Wants
Ice Cream?

399
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:35,153
The Sign Outside
Says 'Closed. '

400
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,187
Dr. O'shea's Not Right
For You.

401
00:17:37,253 --> 00:17:38,253
What'd You Find Out?

402
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,268
Why Are You
Investigating Him?

403
00:17:41,487 --> 00:17:44,687
'Cause I Need To Know
If He Lends Money Interest-Free.

404
00:17:44,754 --> 00:17:46,354
What Did You Find Out?

405
00:17:47,425 --> 00:17:49,120
I Want Some Ice Cream.

406
00:17:50,675 --> 00:17:52,987
Not Until You Learn
To Read.

407
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:56,721
You're Supposed
To Trust Friends.

408
00:17:56,787 --> 00:17:57,554
I Don't Know The Guy.

409
00:17:57,621 --> 00:17:58,654
I Got No Logical Reason-

410
00:17:58,721 --> 00:17:59,988
To Be His Friend?

411
00:18:00,054 --> 00:18:01,687
Have You Never Seen
An After-School Special?

412
00:18:01,754 --> 00:18:03,921
That Is Part Of The Pleasure
Of Friendship:

413
00:18:03,988 --> 00:18:05,687
Trusting
Without Absolute Evidence

414
00:18:05,754 --> 00:18:08,160
And Then Being Rewarded
For That Trust.

415
00:18:08,195 --> 00:18:09,787
You're Taking Pictures
Of A Guy

416
00:18:09,854 --> 00:18:11,487
Who's Having An Affair
With His Own Sister.

417
00:18:11,554 --> 00:18:13,487
And You're Lecturing Me
About The Rewards Of Trust.

418
00:18:13,554 --> 00:18:16,021
There Are Two Types Of People
That Hire Me.

419
00:18:16,088 --> 00:18:17,054
No, Actually,
There Are Three Types

420
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:17,953
Of People That Hire Me,

421
00:18:17,988 --> 00:18:20,105
But The Third Type's Irrelevant
To The Point I Want To Make.

422
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,222
Do You Have A Special Rate Plan
For Being A Pain In The Ass?

423
00:18:22,257 --> 00:18:23,928
One Type Wants To Find Out
That They're Right,

424
00:18:23,963 --> 00:18:25,600
One Type Wants To Find Out
That They're Wrong.

425
00:18:25,667 --> 00:18:27,033
Which Type Am I?

426
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,667
You're The Third Type.

427
00:18:28,734 --> 00:18:30,434
You Lead
With The Irrelevant Types?

428
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,933
You're The Type That Doesn't
Care If You're Right Or Wrong

429
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,033
Because They've Hired Me
To Investigate The Wrong Person.

430
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,267
That's An Actual Type?

431
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:36,734
You Want Me
To Check Out Wilson.

432
00:18:37,862 --> 00:18:39,400
You Want To Find Out
If He's-

433
00:18:39,467 --> 00:18:40,500
How Do You Know About Wilson?

434
00:18:40,567 --> 00:18:41,933
What Do I Do For A Living?

435
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,925
Have You Been Checking Me Out?

436
00:18:44,567 --> 00:18:46,434
I've Been Paying For That?

437
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,634
So Far,
You Haven't Paid For Anything.

438
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,667
You Want To Find Out
He's Pining;

439
00:18:50,734 --> 00:18:52,033
You Want To Find Out

440
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,400
If There's Something
About Him

441
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:54,700
That Will Tell You
He's Gonna Come Back

442
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:57,253
Or Something You Can Use
To Make Him Come Back.

443
00:19:00,901 --> 00:19:03,267
Is There?

444
00:19:04,675 --> 00:19:07,267
No, No, There's Nothing.

445
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:08,600
Sorry.

446
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,867
That Will Be $900.

447
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I Gotta Go.

448
00:19:23,066 --> 00:19:24,801
I'll Get You A Check.

449
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,700
Colonoscopy Was Clean.

450
00:19:35,767 --> 00:19:37,634
Then That Just Leaves Cancer.

451
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,400
The Fact That The Kid's
Colonoscopy Was Negative

452
00:19:39,467 --> 00:19:40,700
Doesn't Prove Anything.

453
00:19:40,767 --> 00:19:43,300
Yes, The Fact
That It Didn't Prove Anything

454
00:19:43,367 --> 00:19:44,300
Didn't Prove Anything.

455
00:19:44,367 --> 00:19:45,343
Excellent Point.

456
00:19:45,378 --> 00:19:46,834
We Don't Know
If The Kid Inherited Anything.

457
00:19:46,901 --> 00:19:48,300
Even If She Did,

458
00:19:48,367 --> 00:19:49,901
Kutner's Theory Is That
The Thing's Intermittent.

459
00:19:49,966 --> 00:19:52,300
The Opening Would Have
To Be Open Shortly Before Death.

460
00:19:52,367 --> 00:19:55,133
Unfortunately, We Can't Know
When Shortly Before Death Is

461
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,634
Until Shortly After Death.

462
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,100
And That Seems
Like An Obstacle.

463
00:19:58,167 --> 00:19:59,534
What If There Was A Way
Around That?

464
00:20:01,097 --> 00:20:03,367
Then We're Kind Of All Sweating
Over Nothing.

465
00:20:03,434 --> 00:20:05,267
Not Around Death,
Around Death As An Obstacle.

466
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:07,434
We Need To See His Colon
At Work.

467
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,734
You Do Know
What Death Means, Right?

468
00:20:09,801 --> 00:20:11,233
Without A Living System,

469
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,267
There's Not Enough Pressure
To Get Fluid All The Way Up.

470
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:16,933
Life We Can't Create, Yet,
But Pressure's Easy.

471
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,425
We Use The Same High Pressure
Water Jet

472
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,315
We Use To Test
Cardiac Workload.

473
00:20:23,933 --> 00:20:25,933
I Mean, He's Not Gonna Be Awake
To Tell Us Where It Hurts-

474
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,253
It's Not Gonna-
Do It.

475
00:20:46,966 --> 00:20:48,133
It's Kinda Stuck.

476
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,500
It's More Than Stuck.

477
00:20:49,567 --> 00:20:51,233
The Bowel's Been Dead
For Six Hours.

478
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,987
No Matter What
You Shoot Up There, It's Closed.

479
00:21:04,667 --> 00:21:05,700
This Is Nuts.

480
00:21:05,767 --> 00:21:07,367
It's Adjustable.

481
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:13,734
It's Working.

482
00:21:13,801 --> 00:21:16,033
Yeah. Wow.

483
00:21:17,487 --> 00:21:19,691
Not Much.
Increase The Pressure.

484
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,738
The Endoscope's Bowing.
Push On The Stomach.

485
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:29,300
Those Are Normal
Bodily Fluids.

486
00:21:29,367 --> 00:21:31,267
Yeah, Normal Bodily Sewage.

487
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,925
Put The Pressure
Back On.

488
00:21:38,066 --> 00:21:40,550
That's The End.
No Leaks.

489
00:21:40,585 --> 00:21:41,515
Wait.

490
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,156
What's That?

491
00:21:42,191 --> 00:21:43,700
That's Just Dark
'Cause I'm At The End.

492
00:21:43,767 --> 00:21:44,634
What If You're Not
At The End?

493
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,100
What If It's A Core Lesion?

494
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:48,133
Maybe A Little More Pressure?

495
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,767
Not Too Much.

496
00:21:50,834 --> 00:21:51,734
If It Is The End And We-

497
00:21:57,633 --> 00:21:58,832
It's Finally Accelerating.

498
00:21:58,899 --> 00:22:01,550
Apple's Heart Rate
Has Become Irregular.

499
00:22:01,585 --> 00:22:02,964
Breathing Is Labored.

500
00:22:02,999 --> 00:22:05,253
Colonoscopy's Still Showing
No Leaks.

501
00:22:05,288 --> 00:22:06,577
What If It Is Autoimmune?

502
00:22:06,612 --> 00:22:10,191
What If We Don't Have
Conversations We've Already Had?

503
00:22:10,226 --> 00:22:11,358
Four Out Of The Five
Didn't Linger.

504
00:22:11,425 --> 00:22:13,224
They Got Sick
And Died.

505
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,725
We Don't Have Time To Dismiss
Things We've Already Dismissed.

506
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,124
Nothing Fits.

507
00:22:17,191 --> 00:22:19,025
See, That's An Example
Of A Conversation

508
00:22:19,091 --> 00:22:20,291
We've Already Had.

509
00:22:20,358 --> 00:22:22,158
She's Sick.
Something Fits.

510
00:22:22,224 --> 00:22:23,858
Ms?
No!

511
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:26,992
Okay, From Now On,
No One Says Anything

512
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:29,592
Unless No One's Said It
Before.

513
00:22:38,391 --> 00:22:39,391
Where Are You Going?

514
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:40,925
You Guys Start
Immuno-Gels

515
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:44,258
On Her Csf To Look
For Hidden Protein Markers.

516
00:22:44,325 --> 00:22:45,325
Then Start Sequencing
Her Genes.

517
00:22:45,391 --> 00:22:46,358
I'm Gonna Start Treatment.

518
00:22:46,425 --> 00:22:47,358
Treatment For What?

519
00:22:47,425 --> 00:22:47,905
Cancer.

520
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,992
It's Not Cancer.
Chemo's Toxic.

521
00:22:50,059 --> 00:22:51,892
It's Something.

522
00:22:51,959 --> 00:22:54,258
Which Means We Should Treat Her
For Something.

523
00:23:11,325 --> 00:23:13,593
She's Fine.
Where's Her Chart?

524
00:23:13,628 --> 00:23:15,725
You Rang Emergency
To Get Her Chart?

525
00:23:15,792 --> 00:23:16,792
I Know.
That Was Bad Of Me.

526
00:23:16,858 --> 00:23:17,964
But I'm Pretty Sure

527
00:23:17,999 --> 00:23:19,258
The Chart's Supposed To Be
Attached To The Bed

528
00:23:19,325 --> 00:23:20,658
So That Gimp Doctors

529
00:23:20,725 --> 00:23:21,758
Don't Have To Look
All Over The Place

530
00:23:21,825 --> 00:23:23,128
While Patients Die.

531
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:30,091
Thank You So Much.

532
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:33,550
And Some Peppermint Tea
When You Get A Chance.

533
00:23:39,525 --> 00:23:41,625
I Need You
To Sign Something.

534
00:23:41,692 --> 00:23:44,692
Consent
To Chemotherapy.

535
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:46,378
You Found Cancer?

536
00:23:47,488 --> 00:23:48,458
No.

537
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:51,862
Then You Have Tests
Indicating-

538
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:52,703
Nope.

539
00:23:52,738 --> 00:23:53,592
Then Why Should I Sign It?

540
00:23:53,658 --> 00:23:55,525
That's A Good Question.

541
00:23:55,592 --> 00:23:57,892
It Deserves
A Complicated Answer.

542
00:23:57,959 --> 00:24:01,858
Placebo Effect.

543
00:24:01,925 --> 00:24:04,059
People Have Confidence
In Doctors,

544
00:24:04,124 --> 00:24:05,892
They Have Confidence
In Diagnoses,

545
00:24:05,959 --> 00:24:07,725
Confidence In Medicine.

546
00:24:07,792 --> 00:24:08,858
Sometimes They Get
A Little Better

547
00:24:08,925 --> 00:24:10,892
Just Because They Think
They Will.

548
00:24:10,959 --> 00:24:12,525
And That Can Make Us Think

549
00:24:12,592 --> 00:24:14,091
That The Wrong Answer
Is The Right Answer.

550
00:24:14,158 --> 00:24:16,025
Which Is Very Bad.

551
00:24:17,253 --> 00:24:19,692
So You Do Have Proof
That It's Cancer

552
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:22,658
But You Can't Tell Me
Because It Might Affect

553
00:24:22,725 --> 00:24:24,625
The Way I React
To The Medicine?

554
00:24:24,692 --> 00:24:28,059
If That Were True, And It Would
Certainly Make Sense,

555
00:24:28,124 --> 00:24:30,862
Do You Think I Could Tell You
That It's True?

556
00:24:41,124 --> 00:24:43,331
I Was Practically Blind
Before The Transplant.

557
00:24:44,224 --> 00:24:45,692
2200 Vision.

558
00:24:45,758 --> 00:24:48,224
Didn't You Cover All This
Personal Stuff With Dr. Foreman?

559
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:51,491
You Don't Care
Who I Used To Be?

560
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:54,358
You're A Post-Corneal Transplant
Math Teacher.

561
00:24:54,425 --> 00:24:57,258
I Deduced That You Were
A Blind Math Teacher.

562
00:24:57,325 --> 00:24:59,692
I Was An Architect.

563
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:07,858
You Gave Up Architecture
After You Could See?

564
00:25:07,925 --> 00:25:09,625
The World Was Ugly.

565
00:25:12,925 --> 00:25:13,959
You Think The World Would Be
Any Different

566
00:25:14,025 --> 00:25:15,879
If Your Leg Was Fine?

567
00:25:17,025 --> 00:25:18,425
No.

568
00:25:18,491 --> 00:25:20,237
Think You'd Be Any Different
If Your Leg Was Fine?

569
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:25,658
I Mean, The Doctors Told Me
That My Life Was Gonna Be

570
00:25:25,725 --> 00:25:28,025
So Much Better
Once I Could See.

571
00:25:28,091 --> 00:25:29,025
I Would Date,

572
00:25:29,091 --> 00:25:31,187
I Would Dance,

573
00:25:31,222 --> 00:25:34,391
But, Uh, The Guys
I Hated Dancing With Before

574
00:25:34,458 --> 00:25:36,025
I Hate Dancing With After.

575
00:25:36,091 --> 00:25:38,491
My Parents Were Still Dead.

576
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:41,191
I Was Still Alone.

577
00:25:41,258 --> 00:25:43,391
You're Fun.

578
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,892
You Don't Seem
All That Different.

579
00:25:50,358 --> 00:25:52,258
I Haven't Given Up.

580
00:25:55,291 --> 00:25:58,592
Wilson's Got A New Job,
Hasn't Started Yet, But-

581
00:25:58,658 --> 00:26:00,025
So Who Are We Following?

582
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:01,825
See That Lady Up There?

583
00:26:01,892 --> 00:26:03,325
You Point At The Target?

584
00:26:03,391 --> 00:26:04,491
No, I'm Following The One

585
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:05,725
Halfway In Between That Point

586
00:26:05,792 --> 00:26:07,124
And That Point.

587
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:12,124
Oh.
Pretty.

588
00:26:12,191 --> 00:26:13,792
Who Hired You?

589
00:26:13,858 --> 00:26:15,224
No One.
I Just Like Her.

590
00:26:15,291 --> 00:26:17,025
You're Stalking Her?

591
00:26:17,091 --> 00:26:19,725
No, No, I Followed Her Out
Of That Bookstore Back There.

592
00:26:19,792 --> 00:26:23,658
You Are Stalking Her,
Just Not For Very Long.

593
00:26:23,725 --> 00:26:25,925
So What Else Can You Tell Me
That I Might Care About?

594
00:26:25,992 --> 00:26:29,658
He Attends This Grief Counseling
Thing Twice A Week

595
00:26:29,725 --> 00:26:30,658
Where They Go Around
The Room

596
00:26:30,725 --> 00:26:32,358
And Cry About Who's Dead.

597
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:34,992
Cameron's Been To His House
Several Times,

598
00:26:35,059 --> 00:26:37,191
They Just Talk About Death

599
00:26:37,258 --> 00:26:39,269
And Losing Loved Ones.

600
00:26:51,325 --> 00:26:52,224
What-

601
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:54,358
What Are You-

602
00:26:54,425 --> 00:26:55,792
If She Turns Her Head,

603
00:26:55,858 --> 00:26:58,124
She's Gonna See That We're
Walking The Wrong Direction.

604
00:26:58,191 --> 00:26:59,124
No, No, No,
She Won't.

605
00:26:59,191 --> 00:27:00,091
I'm Very Nondescript.

606
00:27:00,158 --> 00:27:01,358
Well, I'm Not.

607
00:27:01,425 --> 00:27:02,825
Well, Then You Stay
Four Feet Behind Me.

608
00:27:02,892 --> 00:27:04,725
How Do You Know
What They're Talking About?

609
00:27:04,792 --> 00:27:08,124
I'm In The Same
Grief Counseling Group.

610
00:27:08,191 --> 00:27:09,325
I Recently Lost
My Mother.

611
00:27:09,391 --> 00:27:11,491
You'd Get Laid More Often
If You Told Them

612
00:27:11,558 --> 00:27:12,558
You Lost A Kid.

613
00:27:12,625 --> 00:27:14,025
I Didn't Lose A Kid.

614
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:15,758
You're A P.I.
Who Can't Lie?

615
00:27:15,825 --> 00:27:17,025
I Can Lie.

616
00:27:17,091 --> 00:27:19,391
I'm Just Not All That Good
At It.

617
00:27:19,458 --> 00:27:21,892
Well, Dr. Cuddy's Been Over
To Wilson's Twice

618
00:27:21,959 --> 00:27:23,291
And Phoned
A Bunch Of Times.

619
00:27:23,358 --> 00:27:24,952
Foreman Called Him.

620
00:27:24,987 --> 00:27:27,291
And The Rest Of The Time
Wilson's Been Reading

621
00:27:27,358 --> 00:27:30,558
Meditation Books And Magazines
About Restoring Barns.

622
00:27:30,625 --> 00:27:32,059
Are You Following Me?

623
00:27:32,124 --> 00:27:32,992
No.

624
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:34,091
Are You Lying?

625
00:27:34,158 --> 00:27:35,692
No.
Yes.

626
00:27:35,758 --> 00:27:37,792
?Commit.

627
00:27:37,858 --> 00:27:39,258
It's Making Me
Uncomfortable.

628
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:41,758
Sorry.

629
00:27:43,362 --> 00:27:44,758
You're Very Pretty.

630
00:27:44,825 --> 00:27:47,091
More Uncomfortable.

631
00:27:47,158 --> 00:27:49,625
She's Not Your Type.

632
00:27:49,692 --> 00:27:52,258
Your Type Is Much Stupider
Than Her.

633
00:27:52,325 --> 00:27:53,758
What Did Wilson Say
About Me?

634
00:27:53,825 --> 00:27:54,992
Oh, You've Never Come Up.

635
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,625
In The Grief Counseling
Or In The Other-

636
00:27:58,692 --> 00:28:00,025
Anywhere,
I Got Three Bugs In His Home

637
00:28:00,091 --> 00:28:01,091
And One In His Car.

638
00:28:01,158 --> 00:28:02,358
If I Didn't Know You,

639
00:28:02,425 --> 00:28:03,892
I Wouldn't Even Know
You Existed.

640
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:06,091
Which Is Good News.

641
00:28:06,158 --> 00:28:07,525
Only Two Things You Ignore-

642
00:28:07,592 --> 00:28:08,203
Things That Aren't Important

643
00:28:08,238 --> 00:28:10,258
And Things You Wish
Weren't Important.

644
00:28:10,325 --> 00:28:12,625
And Wishing Never Works.

645
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:27,491
She's Better.

646
00:28:27,558 --> 00:28:29,091
I Can Tell At Once.

647
00:28:29,158 --> 00:28:30,992
Vomiting's A Side Effect
Of The Chemo.

648
00:28:31,059 --> 00:28:33,391
Her Heart Rate's Stabilized,
Breathing's Good.

649
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:35,558
Amylase And Triglycerides
Are Both Coming Down.

650
00:28:35,625 --> 00:28:37,325
I Guess It's Working.

651
00:28:37,391 --> 00:28:39,692
Can't Believe It.
It's Cancer.

652
00:28:39,758 --> 00:28:42,091
It's Not Cancer.

653
00:28:51,988 --> 00:28:53,888
Labs Show That Our Patient
Is Healthier.

654
00:28:53,955 --> 00:28:55,988
She's Gonna Get Sicker.

655
00:28:56,055 --> 00:28:57,521
Then She's Gonna Die.

656
00:28:57,588 --> 00:28:59,222
I Brought Thal Food.

657
00:28:59,289 --> 00:29:00,521
What Did You See In Her?
Nothing.

658
00:29:00,588 --> 00:29:01,988
It's Not Cancer.

659
00:29:02,055 --> 00:29:03,333
All The Tests Say
It's Not Cancer.

660
00:29:03,368 --> 00:29:04,612
They've Always Said
It's Not Cancer.

661
00:29:04,647 --> 00:29:06,588
Treatment Proves
It's Cancer.

662
00:29:06,655 --> 00:29:08,255
Eh, Treatment Proves
It Could Be Cancer.

663
00:29:08,322 --> 00:29:09,421
It's Not Cancer.

664
00:29:09,488 --> 00:29:10,890
This Was Your Diagnosis.

665
00:29:10,925 --> 00:29:11,816
I Never Thought
It Was Cancer.

666
00:29:11,851 --> 00:29:13,469
You Treated
For Cancer.

667
00:29:13,504 --> 00:29:15,071
I Thought That What She Had
Acted Like Cancer.

668
00:29:15,137 --> 00:29:17,605
If It Acts Like Cancer,
Maybe It'll Respond Like Cancer.

669
00:29:17,671 --> 00:29:18,971
It Did.
'Cause It's Cancer.

670
00:29:19,037 --> 00:29:22,065
We Have To Find Something
That Walks Like Cancer,

671
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,037
Talks Like Cancer,

672
00:29:23,104 --> 00:29:26,300
Tastes Like Cancer,
But Isn't Cancer.

673
00:29:26,335 --> 00:29:26,971
No, We Don't.

674
00:29:27,037 --> 00:29:28,925
Better Is Better.
Who Cares Why?

675
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,538
I Do.

676
00:29:29,605 --> 00:29:31,237
And So Does Tetrault.

677
00:29:31,272 --> 00:29:32,749
Who?

678
00:29:32,784 --> 00:29:34,550
The Dead Tuba Player.

679
00:29:34,585 --> 00:29:35,578
Tibalt.

680
00:29:35,613 --> 00:29:37,946
The Point Is,
He Died Last,

681
00:29:38,013 --> 00:29:39,113
But He Died.

682
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:40,946
Which Means
She's Gonna Die Too.

683
00:29:41,013 --> 00:29:42,780
Tibalt Wasn't Receiving
Cancer Medication.

684
00:29:42,846 --> 00:29:43,913
There's A Cancer Drug

685
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,646
That's Used Off-Label
For Arthritis.

686
00:29:45,713 --> 00:29:47,047
There's No Record
Of Arthritis.

687
00:29:47,113 --> 00:29:48,913
Did You Interview
All The Tuba Students?

688
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:49,813
If He Had Joint Pain
In His Hands,

689
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,813
He Couldn't Have Played.

690
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,246
Then It Wasn't In His Hands.

691
00:29:52,312 --> 00:29:53,246
Then Why Do We Care
About His Students?

692
00:29:53,312 --> 00:29:54,713
One Of Them Is Canadian.

693
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:57,780
Brought Him Methotrexate
So He Could Hide His Arthritis.

694
00:29:57,846 --> 00:29:59,546
Already Couldn't Afford
His Insurance.

695
00:29:59,613 --> 00:30:02,680
And That Little Piece
Of Business Cost Me $700.

696
00:30:02,746 --> 00:30:04,880
I'm Gonna Pass It On To The
Patient With A Steep Mark-Up.

697
00:30:04,946 --> 00:30:06,546
This Makes No Sense.

698
00:30:06,613 --> 00:30:08,546
I Know.

699
00:30:08,613 --> 00:30:11,346
She's Dead Unless We Can Find
What's Cancer...

700
00:30:11,413 --> 00:30:13,546
But Not Cancer.

701
00:30:20,546 --> 00:30:22,479
Something's Missing.

702
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,513
I Need An Epiphany.

703
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,579
What Are You Billing
Out At?

704
00:30:33,646 --> 00:30:35,013
$300 An Hour?

705
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,646
Here's Four.

706
00:30:36,713 --> 00:30:38,479
There Are Other Oncologists.

707
00:30:38,546 --> 00:30:39,579
Better Oncologists.

708
00:30:39,646 --> 00:30:40,909
But I Need You.

709
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,913
Let Me Describe
The Symptoms,

710
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,047
Problems, Issues,

711
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:50,813
And Say Whatever
You Feel Like Saying,

712
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,780
Until Something Triggers
An Idea In My Head.

713
00:30:52,846 --> 00:30:54,080
That's Not The Way
It Works.

714
00:30:54,147 --> 00:30:55,513
You Have A Way
Of Thinking About Things.

715
00:30:55,579 --> 00:30:57,479
It's Sloppy,
It's Undisciplined,

716
00:30:57,546 --> 00:30:59,013
It's Not Very Linear.

717
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,479
It Complements Mine.

718
00:31:00,546 --> 00:31:02,425
It Drives Me Down Avenues
That I Wouldn't Otherwise-

719
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,473
House, Please Go Away.

720
00:31:04,508 --> 00:31:06,452
Cancer, But Not Cancer.

721
00:31:06,487 --> 00:31:08,813
Responds To Cancer Treatment,
But There's No-

722
00:31:14,913 --> 00:31:15,946
How Are You?

723
00:31:17,378 --> 00:31:18,246
Don't Do This.

724
00:31:18,312 --> 00:31:20,946
Please.

725
00:31:21,013 --> 00:31:22,680
Don't Do This.

726
00:31:22,746 --> 00:31:24,846
I'm Trying To Move On.

727
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,579
By Hanging Out
With Cameron,

728
00:31:28,646 --> 00:31:30,646
Talking To Cuddy,
Foreman,

729
00:31:30,713 --> 00:31:31,846
But Not Me.

730
00:31:37,379 --> 00:31:42,246
I Paid A Private Investigator
To Spy On You.

731
00:31:44,546 --> 00:31:45,579
You Didn't.

732
00:31:45,646 --> 00:31:46,780
You Want To Move On From Me,

733
00:31:46,846 --> 00:31:48,113
You Got To Deal With Me,
Talk To Me.

734
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:49,613
You Had No Right-

735
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,013
We're Not Friends Anymore.

736
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,546
There's No Trust
To Be Breached.

737
00:31:52,613 --> 00:31:54,013
I Can Have You Followed,

738
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,346
I Can Call You Names,
Tell Your Secrets.

739
00:31:59,546 --> 00:32:01,546
Foreman Did A Ct.

740
00:32:01,613 --> 00:32:03,980
Temporal And Frontoparietal
Regions Are Normal.

741
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,379
Occipital Lobe, Normal.

742
00:32:05,446 --> 00:32:08,479
I Have The Right
To Walk Away From You, House.

743
00:32:08,546 --> 00:32:10,358
There's A World Beyond You.

744
00:32:10,393 --> 00:32:13,646
You Need To Realize That,
And Even If You Don't,

745
00:32:13,713 --> 00:32:15,080
I'm Moving On.

746
00:32:15,147 --> 00:32:16,980
The Next Time You Knock,

747
00:32:17,047 --> 00:32:18,446
I'm Not Answering.

748
00:32:22,946 --> 00:32:24,550
Nothing Yet.
Keep Talking.

749
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:36,646
I'm Sorry.

750
00:32:36,713 --> 00:32:40,913
You Charge Me For Listening In
On My Own Conversations?

751
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,980
Ha.
Yeah, Why Wouldn't I?

752
00:32:43,047 --> 00:32:44,175
How Many Friends
Do You Have?

753
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:44,846
17.

754
00:32:44,913 --> 00:32:47,013
Seriously?

755
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,546
You Have A List?

756
00:32:48,613 --> 00:32:50,780
No, I Knew This Conversation
Was Really About You,

757
00:32:50,846 --> 00:32:52,279
So I Just Gave You
An Answer

758
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:53,413
So You Could Get Back
To Your Train Of Thought.

759
00:32:53,479 --> 00:32:55,446
Well Done.

760
00:32:55,513 --> 00:32:57,312
I Have One.
Had One.

761
00:32:57,379 --> 00:32:58,680
You Know,
Friends Are Important.

762
00:32:58,746 --> 00:33:00,279
You're Gonna Miss-
Shut Up.

763
00:33:00,346 --> 00:33:03,680
Friends Allow You To Not Sit
In A Room By Yourself.

764
00:33:03,746 --> 00:33:04,680
Are You Charging Me
For This?

765
00:33:04,746 --> 00:33:05,880
Are We Friends?

766
00:33:05,946 --> 00:33:07,479
No.
Then Yes.

767
00:33:07,546 --> 00:33:09,980
Do You Wanna Be
My Friend?

768
00:33:10,047 --> 00:33:11,312
No.
You Scare Me A Little.

769
00:33:11,379 --> 00:33:13,047
He Thinks If He's Not A Friend,
He Can't Talk To Me.

770
00:33:13,113 --> 00:33:15,279
We Can Talk, We Can Be
Two Human Beings Talking-

771
00:33:15,346 --> 00:33:16,446
I'm With Him.

772
00:33:16,513 --> 00:33:17,346
Sorry.
Didn't Mean To Interrupt.

773
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:18,513
Yes, You Did.

774
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:19,746
I Was In The Middle
Of A Sentence.

775
00:33:19,813 --> 00:33:22,479
Yes, I Did.
You're Repeating Yourself.

776
00:33:22,546 --> 00:33:24,646
I'm Grateful.
Make Your Point.

777
00:33:24,713 --> 00:33:25,713
It's Like That
"Cancer, But Not Cancer" Thing

778
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,680
You Were Talking About
Before.

779
00:33:26,746 --> 00:33:27,780
Friends Are Friends,

780
00:33:27,846 --> 00:33:29,446
Customers Are Customers,

781
00:33:29,513 --> 00:33:30,946
And Everything Else
Is Everything Else.

782
00:33:31,013 --> 00:33:33,680
If It's Not,
Nothing's Nothing.

783
00:33:36,946 --> 00:33:39,237
And Anything Can Be Anything.

784
00:33:41,646 --> 00:33:44,746
10:10. Stop The Clock.
What?

785
00:33:44,813 --> 00:33:48,479
The World Is Not As Ugly
As She Thinks It Is.

786
00:33:53,613 --> 00:33:55,988
Cancer, But Not Cancer.

787
00:33:57,815 --> 00:34:00,913
Doesn't Make Any Sense
Unless...

788
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,913
Brain, But Not Brain.

789
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,646
Occipital Lobe's Normal.

790
00:34:04,713 --> 00:34:05,746
But Her Eyes Suck.

791
00:34:05,813 --> 00:34:07,413
That Lobe Should Be
Compensating.

792
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:09,312
Since It's Not, That Tells Me
That Something's In There

793
00:34:09,379 --> 00:34:11,612
That Shouldn't Be In There.

794
00:34:11,647 --> 00:34:14,346
Brain, But Not Brain.

795
00:34:14,413 --> 00:34:15,379
Why Are You
In My Office?

796
00:34:15,446 --> 00:34:16,646
To Find The Anomaly,

797
00:34:16,713 --> 00:34:18,880
I Need To Chop Off
The Top Of Her Head.

798
00:34:18,946 --> 00:34:21,047
Pretty Sure I Need
Your Approval For That.

799
00:34:21,113 --> 00:34:23,980
I'm Gonna Trust
Your First Instinct.

800
00:34:24,047 --> 00:34:26,579
I'm Not Usually Confused
When You Say Things Like That.

801
00:34:26,646 --> 00:34:29,646
I'm Ordering Her Cancer
Treatment To Be Continued.

802
00:34:31,413 --> 00:34:34,413
Why Does It Cost $2,300
To Fix A Coffee Machine?

803
00:34:34,479 --> 00:34:36,813
Cancer Stem Cells
Are Real.

804
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,446
They Explain Everything.

805
00:34:38,513 --> 00:34:40,080
They're Like Embryonic
Stem Cells.

806
00:34:40,147 --> 00:34:40,946
They Become Whatever
They Want.

807
00:34:41,013 --> 00:34:41,946
Donor Had Them,

808
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:43,613
The Recipients Got Them.

809
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,746
They Floated Around,
They Landed On An Organ,

810
00:34:45,813 --> 00:34:48,212
Got Bathed In Cytomes
And Partially Differentiated.

811
00:34:48,279 --> 00:34:49,813
And The Key Word There
Is Partially.

812
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,946
In The Tuba Player,
They Became Lung, But Not Lung.

813
00:34:53,013 --> 00:34:54,913
In The Tennis Player, They
Became Heart, But Not Heart.

814
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,880
Stop Me If You've Figured Out
The Pattern.

815
00:34:56,946 --> 00:34:58,113
They Looked As If They Belonged,

816
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,246
But They Weren't Doing
Their Jobs.

817
00:34:59,312 --> 00:35:00,080
And When They Were
Really Needed,

818
00:35:00,147 --> 00:35:01,613
Boom.

819
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,880
Chemo Worked Because Cells
Are Basically Tumors.

820
00:35:04,946 --> 00:35:06,315
Chemo Shrunk Them.

821
00:35:09,394 --> 00:35:10,846
You're Still Gonna Say No,
Aren't You?

822
00:35:10,913 --> 00:35:11,913
You've No Proof.

823
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,279
I Have The Brain Scan.

824
00:35:13,346 --> 00:35:14,946
The Normal Brain Scan.

825
00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:16,980
This Is Why
I Need To Take Off Her Head.

826
00:35:17,047 --> 00:35:18,513
Treat Or To Prove
You're Right?

827
00:35:18,579 --> 00:35:20,080
To Treat.

828
00:35:20,147 --> 00:35:22,346
Chemo's Not Killing
Anything.

829
00:35:22,413 --> 00:35:23,780
It's Just Hiding
The Real Problem.

830
00:35:23,846 --> 00:35:24,913
She's Gonna Crash.

831
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,646
If We Wait
Until She Does Crash,

832
00:35:26,713 --> 00:35:28,179
It Might Be Too Late.

833
00:35:28,246 --> 00:35:31,446
So The Next Step Is What?

834
00:35:31,513 --> 00:35:32,680
I Say No, And Then
You Do Something

835
00:35:32,746 --> 00:35:34,246
To Make Her Crash

836
00:35:34,312 --> 00:35:36,546
So That I'll Think
You've Proven Your Theory?

837
00:35:36,613 --> 00:35:37,780
I Would Never Do That.

838
00:35:37,846 --> 00:35:39,300
No, You Won't.

839
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,300
* To Change The World *

840
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,488
* Start With One Step *

841
00:36:07,013 --> 00:36:09,613
* However Small *

842
00:36:11,312 --> 00:36:14,112
* The First Step
Is Hardest Of All *

843
00:36:15,813 --> 00:36:18,862
* Once You Get Your Gait *

844
00:36:20,513 --> 00:36:23,300
* You'll Be Walking Tall *

845
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:28,800
* You Said You Never Did *

846
00:36:30,047 --> 00:36:32,800
* 'Cause You Might Die Tryin' *

847
00:36:39,513 --> 00:36:41,190
* 'Cause You *

848
00:36:44,513 --> 00:36:47,612
* If You Close Your Eyes *

849
00:36:49,113 --> 00:36:51,878
* Because The House Is On Fire *

850
00:36:53,846 --> 00:36:56,815
* And Think You Couldn't Move *

851
00:36:58,479 --> 00:37:01,410
* Until The Fire Dies *

852
00:37:03,212 --> 00:37:04,379
* The Things You Never Did *

853
00:37:04,446 --> 00:37:06,488
She's Crashing!

854
00:37:07,746 --> 00:37:10,628
* 'Cause You Might Die Tryin' *

855
00:37:12,546 --> 00:37:14,550
* 'Cause You Might
Die Tryin' * *

856
00:37:44,246 --> 00:37:46,979
You Might Want To Check
Her Iv.

857
00:37:47,046 --> 00:37:52,737
From Here, It Looks Like Saline
Instead Of Chemo.

858
00:37:52,772 --> 00:37:54,952
Yeah, They Look Identical.

859
00:37:54,987 --> 00:37:56,887
Still.
You Should Probably Check.

860
00:38:00,021 --> 00:38:01,688
You Switched
Her Meds?

861
00:38:01,755 --> 00:38:03,655
How Could I?
I Had No Access.

862
00:38:03,722 --> 00:38:05,288
Close Her Back Up.

863
00:38:05,355 --> 00:38:06,455
Do The Surgery.

864
00:38:06,521 --> 00:38:08,388
There's No Reason To-

865
00:38:08,455 --> 00:38:09,822
No Reason Not To.

866
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:12,054
The Stupidly Dangerous Part
Is Already Over With.

867
00:38:12,121 --> 00:38:15,054
We're Ready
With The Neural Net.

868
00:38:36,021 --> 00:38:38,488
Is That Someone's Brain?

869
00:38:38,555 --> 00:38:40,487
Except For The Part
That Isn't Brain.

870
00:38:45,788 --> 00:38:47,822
Hey, That's The Patient I-

871
00:38:50,321 --> 00:38:51,588
You Said
She'd Be Fine.

872
00:38:51,655 --> 00:38:53,154
I'm A Better Liar
Than You Are.

873
00:38:53,221 --> 00:38:55,388
I Swapped Her Meds.

874
00:38:55,455 --> 00:38:56,388
I Mean, She's Got
A Brain Problem.

875
00:38:56,455 --> 00:38:57,555
I Coulda Killed Her.

876
00:38:57,621 --> 00:38:59,455
Yup.

877
00:38:59,521 --> 00:39:00,954
The Neural Net Will Show Us

878
00:39:01,021 --> 00:39:03,455
How Fast
Her Neurons Are Firing.

879
00:39:03,521 --> 00:39:04,854
If There's Something
In The Way,

880
00:39:04,921 --> 00:39:07,588
Say...
Brain That's Not Brain,

881
00:39:07,655 --> 00:39:09,854
The Normal Neural Impulses
Will Be Sucked

882
00:39:09,921 --> 00:39:11,088
Into A Vortex

883
00:39:11,154 --> 00:39:13,822
Because They're Not Able
To Do Their Job.

884
00:39:13,887 --> 00:39:15,154
The Computer
Will Then Process It

885
00:39:15,221 --> 00:39:16,388
And Give Us A Picture
Of Where To Cut.

886
00:39:16,455 --> 00:39:18,621
Cool.

887
00:39:18,688 --> 00:39:20,822
Excuse Me?

888
00:39:20,887 --> 00:39:22,588
Sorry, I Thought
That's What You Wanted To Hear.

889
00:39:22,655 --> 00:39:26,154
You Think All This
Is Amazingly Cool.

890
00:39:26,221 --> 00:39:30,455
And You Have No One Else, So
You're Paying A Guy To Listen.

891
00:39:31,893 --> 00:39:33,887
Sorry-Just Trying To Save You
Some Cash.

892
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:35,154
I'm On The Clock.

893
00:39:35,221 --> 00:39:36,355
Yeah, Why Wouldn't You Be?

894
00:39:36,421 --> 00:39:38,190
You Think
This Is Interesting To Me?

895
00:39:38,225 --> 00:39:40,254
House?

896
00:39:40,321 --> 00:39:41,887
I See It.

897
00:39:41,954 --> 00:39:42,887
Can You Get It?

898
00:39:42,954 --> 00:39:44,288
I Think So.

899
00:39:44,355 --> 00:39:46,854
Turns Out
You Didn't Kill Her.

900
00:39:46,921 --> 00:39:50,655
Cool.
You Owe Me $5,000.

901
00:40:06,421 --> 00:40:08,887
Why Are You Just Standing There,
Dr. House?

902
00:40:12,088 --> 00:40:13,887
How'd You Know
Who It Is?

903
00:40:13,954 --> 00:40:17,987
I Can Smell You.

904
00:40:18,054 --> 00:40:20,555
Yeah, Like You're
A Field Of Roses.

905
00:40:25,854 --> 00:40:27,288
Peppermint Tea.

906
00:40:27,355 --> 00:40:29,921
You Ever Hear
Of The Boy Who Cried Wolf?

907
00:40:29,987 --> 00:40:32,531
Never Really Bought That.

908
00:40:32,566 --> 00:40:34,488
I Don't Care
How Often A Kid Cries,

909
00:40:34,555 --> 00:40:36,941
He's Being Eaten By A Wolf,
Mom's Gonna Come Running.

910
00:40:40,722 --> 00:40:44,921
The World Is Ugly.

911
00:40:44,987 --> 00:40:46,221
People Kill.

912
00:40:46,288 --> 00:40:49,288
They Go Hungry.

913
00:40:52,688 --> 00:40:54,112
Just Proving A Point.

914
00:40:59,621 --> 00:41:01,254
People Are Asses.

915
00:41:01,321 --> 00:41:02,788
Why Are You Telling Me
This Stuff?

916
00:41:02,854 --> 00:41:04,121
Because The World
Is Not As Ugly

917
00:41:04,188 --> 00:41:05,555
As You Think It Is.

918
00:41:05,621 --> 00:41:08,987
Your Transplanted Cornea's Fine,
Your Eye Is Fine,

919
00:41:09,054 --> 00:41:12,154
But Your Brain
Wasn't Working Right.

920
00:41:12,221 --> 00:41:14,455
I'm Gonna Take
The Gauze Off Your Eyes Now.

921
00:41:14,521 --> 00:41:16,655
It's Gonna Be Bright.
I Know.

922
00:41:16,722 --> 00:41:19,688
The Brain Cells
That Weren't Brain Cells

923
00:41:19,755 --> 00:41:24,154
Were In The Way Of Processing
Visual Information Correctly.

924
00:41:24,221 --> 00:41:25,621
After The Transplant,
You Could See,

925
00:41:25,688 --> 00:41:26,987
But Not See.

926
00:41:27,054 --> 00:41:28,121
I Could See.

927
00:41:28,188 --> 00:41:29,355
I Could Read.

928
00:41:29,421 --> 00:41:33,021
Yeah, But It Was Dull,
Or Foggy, Or Gray.

929
00:41:33,088 --> 00:41:34,488
I Don't Know.

930
00:41:34,555 --> 00:41:37,221
What I Do Know
Is That Yowere Not Seeing

931
00:41:37,288 --> 00:41:38,321
What Everyone Else
Was Seeing.

932
00:41:38,388 --> 00:41:40,188
And Now?

933
00:41:40,254 --> 00:41:45,088
Things Are Gonna Be...
Beautiful?

934
00:41:45,154 --> 00:41:47,655
Things'll Be
What They Are.

935
00:42:07,921 --> 00:42:10,488
How Do I Look?

936
00:42:14,987 --> 00:42:16,455
You Look Sad.

937
00:42:38,854 --> 00:42:41,021
Hey.

938
00:42:41,088 --> 00:42:43,722
Is There Any Way
I Could Put You On Retainer?
