1
00:00:04,437 --> 00:00:06,462
Cat got your tongue?

2
00:00:06,539 --> 00:00:09,474
No. You killed the cat.
Cut off his head.

3
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:11,669
Need to take a look at this.

4
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:14,646
Mom? Mom.

5
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:16,739
Mom, it's okay.

6
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:23,654
Just a couple of questions
before I can authorize extending
her disability benefits.

7
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:26,317
I don't like her.
She's fat.

8
00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:31,288
I could lose a little weight.

9
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:39,031
You all right?

10
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:43,769
- Actually, before she signs--
- I killed the cat. Lots of blood.

11
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:47,571
It's okay.

12
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:50,673
I have a couple of questions
about some of these dates.

13
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,685
- The first diagnosis--
- Schizophrenia.

14
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:56,847
Dr. Walters, May 11, last year.
The letter's in the medical file.

15
00:00:56,923 --> 00:00:59,858
And April 6--
that was the last day she worked?

16
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:03,362
But she received unemployment
benefits for that week.

17
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,866
We fixed that. I know we did.
We returned the money.

18
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:12,768
That's the canceled check.

19
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:15,399
Not the real one, you know.
It's a copy.

20
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:17,409
And you're the dependent?

21
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:22,312
No. That's my little brother.
I'm 18. Just helping out.

22
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,054
You're all set.

23
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:30,987
Just need a signature.

24
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:33,753
Hey! I'm talking to you!

25
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:37,263
The cat's first.
Now it's your turn, Lucy.

26
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,560
Shut up.
Shut up, shut up!

27
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:45,001
It's okay. She just--
She just needs a little water is all.

28
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:47,062
I'll go get it.

29
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:54,169
Just hold on, okay?
Just--

30
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:58,741
When she comes back,
sign it and we're gonna be done.
We need this, okay? Please.

31
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,422
Okay.

32
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,515
The voices--

33
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,583
The voices aren't real.

34
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,691
What?

35
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,436
Mom? Mom.

36
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:30,540
Mom? Mom! Mom!

37
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:07,777
Thirty-eight-year-old Caucasian woman.
Status: post-respiratory arrest in the field.

38
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,981
Intubated, oxygenating poorly.

39
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:22,265
Dr. Gregory House,
please call Dr. Cuddy at extension 3731.

40
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:28,396
This is a good hospital?

41
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:31,932
Depends what you mean by "good".
I like these chairs.

42
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:37,415
How is she?
Stable. Okay.

43
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:39,314
Your Mom had
a small pulmonary embolism--

44
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:42,286
a blood clot
that got stuck in her lungs,
blocked the oxygen.

45
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:46,553
But the pain started in her leg.
Where the clot started--
her calf.

46
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:49,356
It's called a deep vein thrombosis.
Basically, a bigger clot.

47
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:52,364
It never hurt there before.
I would have noticed.

48
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:56,198
A piece of that broke off, went up the vein,
through her heart and blocked
the blood flow to her lungs.

49
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:57,998
No blood flow, no oxygen.
Okay.

50
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:02,030
Is your Dad here? I have some things
I need to talk to him about.
Uh, my Dad's running a little late.

51
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,846
He's dead. Just talk to me.
I take care of her.

52
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:12,078
All right.
Your mom's blood alcohol was .12.
10:30 in the morning.

53
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:15,018
I gave it to her.
Two ounces of vodka.
It cools her out.

54
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:18,216
But that's the first since Monday.
That was three days ago.

55
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,657
I've been real careful.

56
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:27,924
She hears voices.
She's schizophrenic.
That explains the D.V.T.

57
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:30,697
The alcohol makes her pass out.
She's immobile
for long periods of time.

58
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,933
That doesn't happen.
She's not an alcoholic.
She only drinks when you give it to her?

59
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:37,443
We put her on blood thinners.
You can probably
take her home tomorrow.

60
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,377
It's not the alcohol.
It's gotta be something else.

61
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:43,574
Ofcourse it's the alcohol.

62
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:47,117
Hello!

63
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:49,814
This guy's a professional doctor.

64
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:52,949
Plays golf and everything, I bet.

65
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:56,928
He's not gonna tell you your mom's
an alcoholic without proof.

66
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:59,931
I'm sure he scoped for varices,
checked her esophagus,
ran all kinds of blood tests.

67
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:02,900
Doctors like this,
they don't make assumptions.
They do the work.

68
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,631
I'd be happy to refer you the case, Dr. House.
You seem so interested.

69
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:08,765
What case? It's over.
You're sending her home.

70
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:10,775
- How old is she?
- You're a doctor?

71
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:12,276
Own my own stethoscope.

72
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:15,246
Did I ask you how old she was?
I forget.

73
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:19,718
A 38-year-old woman
with no previous symptoms or history...

74
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,549
presents with deep vein thrombosis.

75
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:23,384
How did she get it?

76
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:26,289
Oral contraceptives, smoking, diabetes, obesity.
What's the point here?

77
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:30,887
A D.V.T. is a D.V.T.
Put her on I.V. Heparin
to prevent future clots.

78
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:34,490
- What's the big mystery?
- Fine. You're all sleepy. You need a clue.

79
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:37,627
She's 38 years old.

80
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:40,571
She's 20 years too young
to get a deep vein thrombosis.

81
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,235
I treated a 12-year-old girl once,
a soccer player. She got kicked in the leg.

82
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:47,336
There was no trauma.
None of the risk factors.
You took a history?

83
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:53,215
I have some notes.
They're not mine, but reliable, I think,
for the purposes of this discussion.

84
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:58,019
As for the immobility, well,
she's real active right now, ofcourse.
Paranoia keeps her limber.

85
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,958
- Paranoia?
- Oh, yeah. She's schizophrenic.

86
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:04,463
And her kid wrote this,
so it might be a little biased.

87
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,590
You know, having to take care
of his nutso mom and all.

88
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,999
You think there's a connection?

89
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:13,505
- Do we include schizophrenia
in the differential for D. V.T.?
- Well--

90
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:15,598
The answer is no.

91
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:18,542
Abnormal dopaminergic pathways
in the brain do not cause blood clots.

92
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:20,340
Schizophrenia
is not the cause of D.V.T.

93
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:24,349
On the other hand, we don't really
know anything about schizophrenia,
so maybe it is connected.

94
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,351
Well, schizophrenia
explains one mystery--

95
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:29,354
why you're so fascinated by
a woman with a bump in her leg.

96
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:32,858
It's like Picasso deciding
to whitewash a fence.
Thanks. I'm more of a Leroy Neiman man.

97
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:35,860
And it is only about the D.V.T.
She's 38 years old. She shouldn't--

98
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:39,420
Right, solve this one,
and you're on your way to Stockholm.
We don't even know how to treat it.

99
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,433
Come on.
Fumigation of the vagina?

100
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:44,436
A little louder.
I don't think everyone heard you.

101
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:48,497
Two thousand years ago,
that's how Galen treated schizophrenics.
The Marcus Welby of ancient Greece.

102
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,769
Oh, clearly
you're not interested.
Oh, I'm interested.

103
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:55,712
I'm interested in how voices in the head
could be caused by malposition of the uterus.
There's a better place for it?

104
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:58,717
Now, what do we got?
We've got lobotomies,
rubber rooms, electric shocks.

105
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:01,345
My, Galen was so primitive.
Where are you going?

106
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:05,755
Going to see the patient.
That all-important human connection.
Thought I'd give it a whirl.

107
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:08,259
You won't talk to patients
because they lie,

108
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:10,761
but give you a patient
with no concept of reality--

109
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:14,459
If it wasn't for Socrates,
that raving, untreated schizophrenic,
we wouldn't have the Socratic method--

110
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:17,970
the best way of teaching everything,
apart from juggling chain saws.

111
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:21,473
Without Isaac Newton,
we'd be floating on the ceiling.
Dodging chain saws, no doubt.

112
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:25,272
And that guitar player
in that English band.
He was great.

113
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:28,404
You think I'm interested
because of the schizophrenia.

114
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:29,914
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

115
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:33,941
Galen was pretty sure
about the fumigation thing.

116
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:37,379
Pink Floyd.

117
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:44,061
- Mom, this is Dr. Gr--
- Gregory House.

118
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,064
Nice to meet you.

119
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,067
Would it be all right
if we spoke alone for a while?

120
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,535
Well, you're gonna
need me to--

121
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,936
I've got your case notes, Doctor.

122
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:55,940
There's a cafeteria downstairs.

123
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:57,942
Get yourself whatever you want,

124
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:01,411
as long as there's enough left over
for a Reuben sandwich,
dry, no fries, hold the pickles.

125
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,915
Should run you
about 5.80 with tax.

126
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,580
I'll page you when we're done.

127
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:17,423
No...

128
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,727
pickles.

129
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:26,862
Nice kid.

130
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:30,808
How much do you really drink?

131
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:40,350
He's really talking to a patient?

132
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:43,354
I don't know who I am anymore.

133
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:46,357
It's a blood clot.
What's so fascinating about that?

134
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:50,191
He likes crazy people.
He likes the way they think.

135
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:53,198
They think badly.
That's the definition of crazy.

136
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:56,030
Why would he like--
They're not boring.

137
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:58,093
He likes that.

138
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:03,608
And the meds?

139
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:06,008
Baseball.
I like baseball.

140
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:10,175
Very nice.
Very sad.

141
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:15,681
My boy and me,
we went to see a game.

142
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:19,191
Not "Mets".
Meds. Medicine.

143
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:25,954
You take what
he tells you to take.

144
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:31,459
No one believes me.

145
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:35,130
I do.

146
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:45,208
I thought
he liked rationality.

147
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:47,218
He likes puzzles.

148
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:49,413
Patients are puzzles?
You don't think so?

149
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:52,013
I think they're people.
Yeah.

150
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:56,653
Well, he hates them,
and he's fascinated by them.

151
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,327
Tell me you can't relate
to that sentiment.

152
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,973
You told Luke
it never hurt before.
Just rough.

153
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:12,510
They didn't hurt.

154
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:14,569
Didn't?

155
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:18,380
Don't lie to him, Limpy.

156
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,385
Lively Lucy never lies to Lucas.

157
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,444
Look what I do to him.

158
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:28,059
Radiation therapist to Oncology.

159
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,425
Learn anything
from the "human connection"?

160
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,430
Yeah.
The Mets suck.

161
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:37,834
Also, for the last two months,
she hasn't shaved her legs.
Because of the tremors, she cuts herself.

162
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:40,565
- The tremors aren't new.
She must always cut herself.
- Exactly.

163
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,574
Something changed
in the last two months.

164
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:47,272
I'm thinking the amount of blood
when she cut herself.
So let's start with some blood work.

165
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:51,043
Collect and send for clotting studies,
P.T., P.T.T., factor five, protein "C" and "S".

166
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:53,244
The whole shebang.
Good luck.

167
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,818
No pickles, and it's cold now.

168
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:59,449
- If it's a Reuben,
that's the way he likes it.
- Everyone, this is Luke.

169
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:02,460
- Allison Cameron. It's nice to finally meet you.
- Yeah. Save it. We're busy.

170
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:06,294
Luke, give us another half hour
with your mom.
We need to do some tests.

171
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:12,070
Nice kid.

172
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:15,073
Take her off the psych meds.
That way we'll know what's what
on the physical side.

173
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:18,599
And who knows,
we might get more out of her.

174
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:23,638
Don't worry. No pickles.

175
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,008
Happy birthday.

176
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,482
Okay. Whose?

177
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:35,823
I was going through your mail,
and it was on a form.
Happy birthday.

178
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,298
Oh.

179
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,844
No! No blood!
Not mine!

180
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,846
For the test.
Dr. House told us--

181
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:59,214
You're gonna steal it! Sell it!
No! No blood!

182
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:02,721
No! No blood!
No! No blood!

183
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:04,722
Haldol, five milligrams, stat.

184
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:08,123
No! No! No!

185
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:11,721
No! No!

186
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:14,630
No! No! Oh, no!

187
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,362
N-No!

188
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,441
No.

189
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,742
Well, good news.
The lab says it's not strep,
so we're done.

190
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,755
Wait a second.
No, really not strep.

191
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:41,224
The boys in the lab, sure,
they're hard drinkers,
but they're pros, you know.

192
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:43,853
Plus, your kid actually has none
of the symptoms for strep.

193
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,864
It was quicker running the test
than arguing with you.
My point is, go!

194
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,867
I just wanted to ask
your opinion, Doctor.

195
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,870
She's having a birthday party next week,
and she's upset that
I'm getting a sugarless cake.

196
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,873
The other kids hate it.
This is why you're here.

197
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,876
Sugar is the leading cause
of obesity in America.

198
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,879
You want a doctor to scare her
about the dangers of sugar.

199
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,882
She needs to get her weight
under control.

200
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:10,388
Well, you know, I feel sorry
for those other kids, Wendy,
who don't have a mom like yours--

201
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:14,893
a mom who knows
that sugar causes heart disease,
appendicitis and athlete's foot.

202
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,895
That's not fair.
Oh, yes, it is.
No, I get it.

203
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:21,399
You want her to slim down a little
so she can wear pretty clothes like yours.

204
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,401
Love the bracelets.

205
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,404
Hey, what about matching outfits?
You could be twins.

206
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,872
She can't be your daughter.

207
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:31,466
It's impossible!
You look way too young.

208
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:33,478
Happy birthday.

209
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,480
Get the kid
a damned ice cream cake.

210
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:38,676
Dr. Wyland to Obstetrics.
Dr. Wyland, Obstetrics.

211
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:41,914
- You drugged her.
- Actually, I didn't.

212
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,547
I've taken her off
all medication.
Your guy Foreman gave her Haldol.

213
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:48,286
We needed blood for tests.
I assumed that was
the only way to get it.

214
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,421
He knocked her out.
Look, I have a cane,
and I know how to use it.

215
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,489
I hired you.
You work for me.

216
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,194
Okay.

217
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:58,293
Can I go now, boss?

218
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:03,407
The Haldol changes her.

219
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:07,809
She says it makes her soul numb.
Don't give it to her.

220
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,285
"If there be rags enough,

221
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:18,187
he will know her name
and be well pleased remembering it".

222
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:23,427
You okay?

223
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:25,486
Old days.

224
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:30,568
"For in the old days,

225
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:33,571
"though she had young men's praise
and old men's blame,

226
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,608
among the poor,
both old and young gave her praise".

227
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:42,106
Oh!

228
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:48,442
Help! Somebody help!

229
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:58,795
So, when I said no psych meds,
I'm just curious--
which word didn't you understand?

230
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:01,799
The Haldol had nothing to do
with the bleed.

231
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:04,734
You know that.
I used it purely as a chemical restraint.

232
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:06,964
Oh, great.
Well, that's good to hear.

233
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:11,669
So she won't experience any
of those pesky little side effects you get
when your motives aren't pure.

234
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,974
Oh--
Those side effects are so rare!

235
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:17,812
What, passing out,
increased confusion, depression?
That's not gonna happen.

236
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:21,944
That's not gonna screw up our diagnosis,
'cause you just used it to restrain her.
I'm so relieved.

237
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:23,955
She spit in my face.

238
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:26,958
That must have been
so frightening for you.

239
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:29,961
What was I supposed to do,
tie her down?
Yeah. Anything but give her drugs.

240
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,963
That's basically my point.

241
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:36,593
The clotting studies. Pretty fast.
Did you promise to date the entire lab?

242
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:39,035
No, I save that for emergencies.

243
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:42,471
I told them she bled out two units
and if it happened again, she'd die.

244
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:45,476
If it had happened at home,
she would have died.

245
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:48,308
The E.R. doc,
he was gonna send her home.

246
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,781
- I used my best judgment.
- It turns out your best judgment
is not good enough.

247
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:55,308
- Here's an idea-- next time, use mine.
- I think they're choosing a movie.

248
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:58,151
Why did the patient bleed out?

249
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:00,817
The clotting studies so far
are normal.

250
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:03,828
Well, cover your ears if you don't
want me to spoil the ending.

251
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:07,559
Everything was normal,
except for a prolonged P.T. time.

252
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:12,127
- Which means what?
- Usually it means whoever
drew the blood didn't do it right.

253
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:14,536
Oh, that's right,
'cause you drew the blood.

254
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:19,066
- But you were precise because you knew
the tube was purely for the P.T. study.
- That's right.

255
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:22,580
And I'm right with you.
I trust this result,
for two reasons--

256
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,208
"A", because you are
a good doctor,

257
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:28,014
and "B", because
five milligrams of I.V. Haldol...

258
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:31,022
makes for a spectacularly
cooperative patient.

259
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:35,689
The prolonged P.T. time
makes me think she's got
a vitamin "K" deficiency.

260
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:38,662
Vitamin "K" would explain the bleed,
but not the clot.

261
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:42,098
Without vitamin "K",
protein "C" doesn't work.
Without protein "C", she clots.

262
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:45,102
Clotting and thinning
all at the same time.

263
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,537
What about another drug
interacting with Heparin,
an antibiotic like ampicillin?

264
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:51,542
That would cause the bleed.
Clever,
but she's not on ampicillin.

265
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:55,046
Two months ago,
she complained of a sore throat,
and he got her ampicillin.

266
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:57,412
- Which she refused to take.
- He just said she didn't take it.

267
00:16:57,483 --> 00:17:00,680
What is it, everybody lies
except for schizophrenics
and their children?

268
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:04,712
It's more likely than malnourishment.
Why not scurvy or the plague?

269
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,350
Gee, I wish my idea
was as cool and with-it as yours.

270
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:10,623
What is yours, by the way?
Do you have one?
Alcohol.

271
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:14,496
Simple. It causes immobility,
which explains the D.V.T.

272
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:19,765
It also causes cirrhosis,
which explains the bleed
and the prolonged P.T. time.

273
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:22,739
- Let's ultrasound the liver.
- Three theories.

274
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:26,073
Check out her place
for ampicillin and diet.

275
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:28,079
Then ultrasound her liver.

276
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:31,310
Let's find out who's right
before she bleeds to death.

277
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:47,488
101.

278
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:59,142
So House says the kid is sensitive,
thinks he takes good care of her.

279
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:02,408
But if we don't find anything,
why let him know we did it in the first place?

280
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,415
What's the point?

281
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:09,216
Why not just make old Foreman
lift the key from the kid's backpack?

282
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:26,631
Looks like Luke
sleeps in the living room.

283
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,471
Nothing in there.

284
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:38,482
He lays out her clothes?

285
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:42,680
Enough organization, enough lists,
you think you can control
the uncontrollable.

286
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:46,815
Fix her meds, fix her clothes,
maybe you can even fix her.

287
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,561
Pick that up
on your psych rotation?

288
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:03,606
Trifluoperazine, Thorazine, Clozarile.

289
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:05,973
Whew.
They tried everything.

290
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:10,310
The ampicillin--
never touched it.

291
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:14,546
There goes Cameron's theory.
Oh, God, I hope it's not
a vitamin "K" deficiency.

292
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:24,421
Damn.

293
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,430
Breakfast, lunch and dinner.

294
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,432
House was right.

295
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,937
That's the only thing
she'll eat.
Yeah.

296
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,941
The problem is,
you can't actually live on this stuff.

297
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,945
I checked it out. I looked on the box.
All the nutritional values are solid.

298
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,947
There's plenty
of protein and calories.

299
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:47,042
Yeah, vitamin "A" and "C", but no "K".
That's why your mom got sick.

300
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:52,751
So what's the plan then?
Load her up with vitamin "K".

301
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:57,158
That's it?
If it all checks out, you can
take her home in a couple of days.

302
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:03,457
Oh, God, you're upset
about something.

303
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:08,467
You're gonna open up to me now,
aren't you?
It's all my fault.

304
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:11,542
Here we go.

305
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:15,603
Okay, I'm gonna say this once:
You have done a very good job
taking care of your mother.

306
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:19,879
If this was all she'd eat,
then what else could you do?
Gosh, just being a kid is a full-time job.

307
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:23,945
Shut up! I'm 18.
I should be able
to take care of my mom.

308
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:28,555
I almost killed her.
Good example.

309
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:33,564
Just the time it takes
to express those ridiculous,
self-centered teenage ideas.

310
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,691
I don't envy your schedule.

311
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:40,402
No pickles.

312
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:42,599
My mom
doesn't like 'em either.

313
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:44,665
Smart woman.

314
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:48,812
Before she got sick,
I didn't like how bossy she was.

315
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,475
Always telling me what to do,
the right way to do it.

316
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:56,947
Never thought I'd miss that.

317
00:20:57,022 --> 00:21:00,651
Oww.

318
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:04,352
You should get that looked at.

319
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:07,364
I still don't buy
a vitamin "K" deficiency.
House was right.

320
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,367
That usually makes you happy.
Less work for us.

321
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:13,962
The kid feeds his mom
a steady diet of booze,
and the problem is too many burgers?

322
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,974
The kid's in a tough situation.
You do what you gotta do to survive.

323
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:20,478
Feeding alcohol to an alcoholic
is not a survival technique.

324
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:22,877
Where I come from, if it works--
Yeah, right.

325
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:26,941
I'm rich.
I couldn't possibly understand
what this kid is going through.

326
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:32,590
Just because you're drinking
pricier stuff doesn't mean
you don't have a problem.

327
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:35,593
You've seen someone
stagger down that road?

328
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:38,596
No way vitamin "K"
is the whole story.

329
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:46,136
It's not broken.

330
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:48,138
See this, right here?

331
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:52,506
It's the epiphyseal plate,
otherwise known as the "growth plate".
What's wrong with it?

332
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:55,239
Amazing thing, this bone.

333
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,340
If you know how to read it,
it can tell you how old someone really is.

334
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:01,648
- Exactly how old.
- Great.

335
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,553
Mmm, not even 15.

336
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:06,557
Almost though.

337
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,389
Two weeks away.
Maybe a month.

338
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:14,160
Last week.
I was 15 last week.

339
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:17,030
Happy birthday to both of us.

340
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:19,935
If you're gonna lie though, go big.
Go 21.

341
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,940
That way
you won't need your crazy mom
to help you buy vodka.

342
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:26,500
Uh, great.
Thanks for the tip.

343
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:32,812
Now, when I bring my mom home,
is there anything I need to know
about taking care of her?

344
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:35,819
I suppose your biggest worry
isn't the booze.

345
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:38,822
You're 15, basically no mom.

346
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:41,518
If Child Welfare let kids get away
with that, they wouldn't need
those nice foster homes,

347
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:43,527
and that would make them sad.

348
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:45,495
They'd put her someplace too.

349
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:47,555
My life is working.

350
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:51,101
Not the word I'd use.

351
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:54,730
Most 15-year-old kids are doing
what they're supposed to be doing.

352
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:56,740
You know, they're huffing glue,
catching crabs.

353
00:22:56,808 --> 00:22:59,436
If you turn me in, I'll sue you.

354
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:01,706
That's privileged information.

355
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:04,305
Oh, relax.
It's not even your X-ray.

356
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,487
She's awfully calm.

357
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,546
House wrote new orders.

358
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:19,425
There's a little bit of scarring.
Not much.

359
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:21,432
Not enough to--
It's cirrhosis.

360
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,593
Oh, but she doesn't drink.

361
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:25,659
Congratulations.
You win.

362
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:30,297
Actually,

363
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,510
no one wins.

364
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:36,513
Tumor. Cystic?

365
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:38,947
Solid mass.

366
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:41,076
Cancer.

367
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:46,924
The vitamin "K" caused the D.V.T.
and aggravated the liver,

368
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:49,927
but the tumor's
the real reason for the bleed.

369
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:52,156
The tumor's the problem.

370
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:54,698
Mrs. Palmero, I'm Dr. Wilson.

371
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:58,395
I'm afraid I have some bad news
from your ultrasound.

372
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,404
You have cancer.

373
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:36,339
It's big.
5.8 centimeters.

374
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:39,138
We do nothing,
she dies from liver failure
within 60 days.

375
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:41,645
- She needs a transplant.
- That's gonna happen.

376
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:46,082
- She's 38 years old. She's a mother.
- She's a schizophrenic mother with no money,
on the public dole, in fact,

377
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,585
who knocks back vodka
every time a breeze blows her way.

378
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:51,918
Mickey Mantle had
a whole bar named after him.
He got a transplant.

379
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,924
Yeah, well, Lucy can't switch-hit.

380
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:56,358
Plan "B"--
surgery to resect the tumor.

381
00:24:56,428 --> 00:25:00,228
Joe Bergin does the gamma knife thing.
Laser cauterizes while it cuts, saves more liver.

382
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:02,994
The tumor's way too big.
He won't even consider it.

383
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:06,435
Not a big risk-taker, Bergin.
Won't even drink milk
on its expiration date.

384
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,269
He has no discretion.
5.8 centimeters is past
the surgical guidelines.

385
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:15,176
Would he do it at 4.6?

386
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:20,275
Why don't we just say it's zero?
Then we don't need him at all.
Tumors grow, they don't shrink.

387
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,343
This one does.

388
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:26,723
Ninety-five percent ethanol.

389
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:30,056
The ethanol dehydrates
the tumor cells.

390
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:32,119
Literally sucks them dry.

391
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:35,933
It shrinks the tumor temporarily.

392
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:37,992
How temporarily?

393
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:41,828
Well, if we're lucky,

394
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:47,701
just long enough to fool the surgeon.

395
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:57,982
Dr. Shopius, report to Psych Exam.

396
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:01,287
Dr. Shopius, Psych Exam.

397
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:03,293
Good morning, Dr. House.

398
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:05,295
Good morning, Dr. Cuddy.

399
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:07,297
Love that outfit.

400
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:09,993
It says, "I'm professional,
but I'm still a woman".

401
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,502
Actually, it sort of yells
the second part.

402
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,506
Yeah, and your big cane
is real subtle too.

403
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:19,704
Gotta go. Those running noses aren't
just gonna start walking on their own.

404
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:22,303
The clinic can wait.

405
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,940
How long?
Maybe we could catch a movie.

406
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:28,110
You should know by now
my doctors have no secrets from me.

407
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:31,488
I don't believe it.

408
00:26:31,556 --> 00:26:34,047
Who came running to Mommy?

409
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:37,117
It doesn't matter who.
The point is, I know exactly what you did.

410
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:41,322
You have no idea
what I'm talking about.

411
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:45,335
Somebody knows about a bad thing you did.
That's a big field.

412
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:49,635
But somebody you think might've told me.
That narrows it down quite a bit.

413
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:52,643
Someone who views me
as a maternal authority figure.

414
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:56,044
Ayoung person perhaps?
How am I doing?
Think I'm gonna get there?

415
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:59,049
Presumably hospital business.
How many patients--
It's Cameron.

416
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:01,051
She found out about my birthday.

417
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:06,056
I thought she told you and I'd have to
stand here and smile while you gave me
a sweatshirt or a fruit basket.

418
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,524
You know, made me feel
that deep sense of belonging.

419
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:13,155
Actually, I was just gonna remind you,
you owe me six clinic hours this week.

420
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:15,222
Oops.

421
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,074
Hi, this is Dr. Cuddy.

422
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:28,135
I need all the charts
on Dr. House's current patients.

423
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,885
I've tried everything.
Mm-hmm.

424
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:39,185
"Pulling the tongue,
ice packs on the throat, hitting yourself,

425
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:41,487
the groin pinch".

426
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:46,154
Well, you've certainly covered
all the normal medical bases.

427
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:49,166
Uh, how are you hitting yourself
though?

428
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:51,896
Is it with an open hand
or a fist?
Open hand.

429
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:54,905
Uh-huh. Well, that's--
that's how they teach it
at Harvard Med.

430
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:56,964
How hard though?

431
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,835
I'm sorry. I missed that.
Could you do that again?

432
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:03,505
Uh--

433
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:05,515
That's-- That's very good.

434
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:07,517
It's hiccups.

435
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:10,019
I need to
speak with you now.
Mm-hmm.

436
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:12,022
I need to go pee-pee.

437
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,888
Dial it up a notch and repeat.
I'll be back.

438
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:27,571
Ooh.
Girl in the boy's bathroom.

439
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:29,573
Very dramatic.

440
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:32,633
It must be very important,
what she has to say to me.

441
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:37,247
Yesterday your patient's tumor
was 5.8 centimeters.

442
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:39,840
Today it's 4.6.
How does that happen?

443
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:43,354
Well, at a guess,
I'd say, "That Dr. House
must be really, really good.

444
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:45,355
Why am I wasting him
on hiccups?"

445
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:47,414
I wash before and after.

446
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:53,327
You also requisitioned
20 c.c.'s of ethanol.

447
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:56,333
What patient was that for?
Or are you planning a party?

448
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,392
Do me a favor.

449
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:03,267
I was gonna say leave,
but that works.

450
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:07,411
- You shrunk the tumor.
- Only way to get the guy
to do the surgery.

451
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:11,108
Fraud was the only way?

452
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:14,117
There is a reason
that we have these guidelines.

453
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:17,120
I know. To save lives.
Specifically, doctors' lives.

454
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:20,123
And not just their lives,
but their lifestyles.

455
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:23,627
Wouldn't want to operate
on anyone really sick.
They might die and spoil our stats.

456
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:26,289
Bergin has a right to know
what he is operating on.
True.

457
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:29,492
I got all focused
on her right to live and forgot.
You do what you think is right.

458
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:41,511
You really didn't know?

459
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:44,207
No, I didn't.

460
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,216
And, frankly, I'm angry.

461
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,218
Which I'm guessing
is the correct response.

462
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:51,653
- Ofcourse, I'll know better once
you tell me what you're talking about.
- Your birthday.

463
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:53,657
Oh.

464
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:56,660
Anger was a bad guess.

465
00:29:56,728 --> 00:30:01,825
Well, normally, I'd put on a festive hat
and celebrate the fact that the Earth
has circled the sun one more time.

466
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,835
I really didn't think
it was gonna make it this year,

467
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:08,304
but darn it if it wasn't
the little planet that could
all over again.

468
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:11,740
It's a birthday.
It's an excuse to be happy.

469
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,801
You think that's lame?

470
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:18,372
Why are you here?
Did you buy me a pony?

471
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:22,409
I'm just waiting for the surgery.

472
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:27,117
Yeah, well, go scrub in.

473
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:41,063
All right, we're done.
Close her up.

474
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:51,745
The tumor didn't just walk itself into a bar
and order up a double shot of ethanol.

475
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:54,250
Someone shrunk it down.

476
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:57,755
I'm sorry.
It was very, very wrong.

477
00:30:57,822 --> 00:31:00,416
House is lucky
I didn't just close her up.

478
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:03,426
He tries it again,
that's what happens.

479
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:05,485
I'll pass it on.

480
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:10,367
It looks like the surgeon got it all,

481
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:13,131
but she's gonna have to have
some chemotherapy.

482
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,638
What kind is it?

483
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,505
Luke, stop writing.

484
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,652
If you stop for a second,
it's not all gonna fall apart.

485
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,154
Give yourself a break
once in a while.

486
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:34,157
The fact is, your Mom's gonna have
an extra drink every now and then.

487
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,250
No. No. She won't.
She doesn't.

488
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:38,261
Fine.

489
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:42,288
There are some things you just can't fix.
That's all I'm saying.

490
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:46,736
That's how you'd handle it,
something like this?
You'd just give up?

491
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:50,040
No.

492
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:52,303
I'd do it just like you.

493
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:58,678
It's an infusion.
She's gonna have a drain
in her abdomen.

494
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:02,117
You're going to have to check
for possible infection.

495
00:32:02,186 --> 00:32:04,120
Lucas Palmero?

496
00:32:04,188 --> 00:32:07,680
Trina Wyatt, Child Services,
State of New Jersey.

497
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,693
Can I help you?
This is a private room.

498
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,696
He's only 15 years old,
a minor.

499
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,698
He's in a tough living situation.

500
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,700
We're just here to help.

501
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,566
I don't need your help.
Fifteen?

502
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:24,301
Lucas, you're gonna have to
come with us right now.

503
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:26,036
Where are you taking him?

504
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:29,511
Until the determination is made,
he'll be housed at Children's Services.

505
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:33,141
I don't want to be "housed".
I live with my mom.

506
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:35,708
Not for the next few days.

507
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:39,052
Come on.
Let's not make this difficult, huh?

508
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:42,925
Mom?

509
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:44,985
Mom?

510
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,121
I love you.

511
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:54,332
When the Mets lost,
you remember?

512
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:56,396
Yeah.

513
00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:59,734
I remember.

514
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,371
I love you.

515
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:25,068
Cuddy didn't say anything about
pushing Bergin to finish the surgery?
Not a word.

516
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:28,071
Some kind of mind game.
She's waiting for me to crack.

517
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:31,370
Well, either that
or she's just being nice.
Yeah, right.

518
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:34,775
You said you wouldn't call.
You're a real bastard, you know.

519
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:42,411
Yeah, I get that a lot.

520
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:49,115
I don't think Mom's crazy.

521
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:58,766
"For in the old days,
though she had young men's praise
and old men's blame,

522
00:33:58,836 --> 00:34:03,170
among the poor,
both old and young gave her praise".

523
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:12,408
You called Social Services.

524
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:14,417
It was you.

525
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:17,010
N-- No. No.

526
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:19,648
It's okay, it's okay.
I get it.

527
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,994
He'll have an easier time
dealing with the system.

528
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:28,499
Sure, he won't be with his real mother,
but his real mother's sick.

529
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:31,057
Someone needs to take care of him.

530
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,404
I'm not gonna live here.

531
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:39,842
What would his future have been,
taking you to chemo and back on the bus?

532
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,880
And even if the cancer's
in complete remission,

533
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:45,882
he'll still have a mother
who hears voices.

534
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:49,408
Talk no more.

535
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:51,421
Talk no more.

536
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:55,516
"Look what I do to him, Limpy".

537
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:58,118
You said that.

538
00:34:58,196 --> 00:35:00,460
I checked the phone records.

539
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:04,893
Only one call from this room.

540
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:07,904
Smart, because they
charge you two bucks a call.

541
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:10,770
It was to Social Services,
the State of New Jersey.

542
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:15,972
You're his mother.
You couldn't do it to him anymore.

543
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:21,208
Good for you.

544
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,313
Schizophrenics
can make rational decisions.

545
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:28,950
On the small stuff, yeah--
when to sleep, what to drink, you know.

546
00:35:29,026 --> 00:35:31,722
"No lemonade,
but I'll take some hemlock
if you've got it".

547
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,730
Huh.
Your man Socrates.

548
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:38,929
But giving up your son
because it's better for him,
it's so sane, it's so rational.

549
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:41,938
Self-sacrifice is not
a symptom of schizophrenia.

550
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:43,940
It excludes the diagnosis.

551
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:46,943
She's not schizophrenic?
Look, she's 36 years old
when she first presents.

552
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:49,445
It's a little late,
but within the parameters.

553
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:53,143
The internist sends her to a shrink.
One shrink sends her to the next.

554
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:56,516
She tells them all she's not crazy.
The drugs don't work.
And why would they if she's not a head case?

555
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:59,351
She got clearer
when I took her off the psych meds.

556
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:05,128
You think I'm crazy.
Well, yeah,
but that's not the problem.

557
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:08,290
Didn't we
just leave your office?
I like to walk.

558
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:11,528
Is that Dr. Jeffrey Walters?
Hi.

559
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:14,463
My name is Greg House.
I'm a doctor--

560
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:19,095
Oh, is that the time?
I'm-- Yeah. I'm sorry.
My watch must have stopped.

561
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:23,732
Uh, listen, you treated a patient
about 18 months ago,
a woman named Lucille Palmero.

562
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:26,800
I wondered if you recalled
running any tests...

563
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:29,739
at all.

564
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:34,247
Oh, how terribly foolish of me, Doctor.
Is it that late?

565
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:37,981
Yes, I'm calling from London, you see?
Must have got my times mixed up--

566
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:47,963
I have a headache.
It's my only symptom.

567
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:51,433
I go to see three doctors.
The neurologist tells me it's an aneurysm.

568
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:53,697
The immunologist says
I've got hay fever.

569
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,705
The intensivist can't be bothered.

570
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:59,209
Sends me to a shrink,
who tells me that I'm punishing myself
'cause I want to sleep with my mommy.

571
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:03,771
- Maybe you're just not getting enough sleep?
- Pick your specialist, you pick your disease.

572
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:07,284
If it's not schizophrenia,
what else presents
with psych symptoms?

573
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:09,945
- Porphyria.
- The Madness of King George.

574
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:13,286
What about that copper thing?
What's it called? It's genetic.

575
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:15,222
The body accumulates
too much copper.

576
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,761
Oh, um, uh, Wilson's Disease?

577
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:19,762
Yeah.
Very rare.

578
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,764
Nice. I like it.

579
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:24,960
- If any of us did this, you'd fire us.
- Well, that's funny.

580
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:28,062
I thought I encouraged you
to question.
You're not questioning.

581
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,573
You're hoping.
You want it to be Wilson's.

582
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,905
Boom. Give her
a couple of drugs, she's okay.

583
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,002
July 17.
An appointment with a Dr. Karn.

584
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:38,640
She didn't keep it.
She never kept another appointment
with a shrink he made after that.

585
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:41,913
Karn is not a shrink.
I looked him up.
He's an ophthalmologist.

586
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:44,420
Now why would she
want her eyes checked?

587
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:46,820
Wilson's presents with cataracts,
I think.
Yes, it does.

588
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:52,158
It also causes slight cirrhosis,
which Dr. Chase so eagerly
attributed to alcohol.

589
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:54,663
So what are we still doing here?

590
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:56,359
Lucy!

591
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:58,994
I don't think you're crazy.

592
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:01,868
Neither do I.

593
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:05,272
But I'm crazy.
Come on.
Lean over here.

594
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,334
Come on.

595
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:10,680
That's it.

596
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:14,844
Put your hands on the bar here
and your chin in here.

597
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:16,853
Thank you.

598
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:19,287
You're gonna see
a bright light, okay?

599
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:22,292
Your body might be accumulating
too much copper.

600
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,727
If it is, this should help us
see something
called Keyser-Fleischer rings--

601
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:28,865
copper-colored circles
around your corneas.

602
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:30,798
Wow.

603
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:36,067
I guess we should start
treating her for Wilson's.

604
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,233
That's what I'd do.

605
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:53,252
"I will talk no more
of books or the long war,

606
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:58,956
"but walk by the dry thorn
until I have found some beggar
sheltering from the wind...

607
00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:03,329
"and there manage the talk
until her name come round.

608
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:08,805
If there be rags enough,
he will know her name
and be well pleased remembering it."

609
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:15,374
"For in the old days,
though she had young men's praise
and old men's blame,

610
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:19,815
among the poor,
both old and young gave her praise".

611
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:31,186
Hi, Mrs. Palmero.
Ready to go home?

612
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:34,297
Almost.

613
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:36,595
Mom?

614
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:48,107
How are you?

615
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:50,943
I'm good.

616
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:55,952
Oh!

617
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,545
Oh--

618
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:01,557
Oh, you really need a haircut.

619
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:29,108
Dr. House.

620
00:41:30,187 --> 00:41:32,178
Luke, we're making
Dr. House wait.

621
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:34,781
That's okay.
We're just here for the music.

622
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:37,191
Luke, come on.

623
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:51,064
I'm being discharged.
I heard a rumor.

624
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,842
Thank God I had cancer, huh?

625
00:41:56,046 --> 00:42:00,540
- It's terrible having everybody
think you're nuts.
- Really?

626
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:05,581
- I called to thank you.
Did you get my message?
- Yes.

627
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:10,227
You're welcome.

628
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:15,622
I'm never thanking you.
You turned me in.

629
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:20,830
I told you we were doing okay.
It was none of your business.

630
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:23,305
Look, I don't care
how you were living.

631
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:26,036
I just wanted you out of my life.

632
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:30,541
That's why I had Dr. Cuddy
call Social Services.

633
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:49,398
You okay?

634
00:42:49,466 --> 00:42:51,400
You were right.

635
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:55,734
It wasn't the D.V.T.
It was the schizophrenia.
I know.

636
00:42:55,806 --> 00:42:58,138
She's not nearly
as interesting anymore.

637
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:02,635
Isn't it your birthday
around now?
