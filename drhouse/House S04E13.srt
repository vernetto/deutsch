1
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,500
Whoever Thought Walking
In A Circle At Two Miles An Hour

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,500
Would Be Draining?

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,700
Fresh Air,
Exercise.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,300
You Know, Some Things
Do Have Their Negative Sides.

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,400
Our Income Just Got Cut
In Half.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,100
And We Get To Spend
Twice As Much Time Together.

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,200
More, If You Don't Leave
Before Your Lunch Hour's Over.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,200
Out Of My Way.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,700
We Have A Legal Right
To Hold You Up For 15 Seconds.

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,700
15...

11
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,100
- 14,
- One.

12
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,400
11,

13
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,700
<I>10,</I>

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,500
Just Trying To Do
My Job.

15
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,200
Hey, Relax, Three More Seconds,
And You Can Go.

16
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,800
Are You Telling Me
What To Do?

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,300
It's Okay.

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,700
Just Take A Breath.

19
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,000
Get The Hell Off Me.

20
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,700
I Think It's Been 15.

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,900
You Okay?

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,300
Oh, My God, Jeff!

00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,800
Paging Dr. Spencer.

27
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,300
Paging Dr. Statham,
Dr. Statham, Please.

28
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,400
This Place Is A Mess.

29
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,800
Welcome To A World
Without Nurses.

30
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,200
Here, You Can Start
With These.

31
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,900
<I>It's Not My Fault.</I>

32
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,200
<I>I Didn't Lose Nurses.</I>

33
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,500
Cuddy Was Looking For You.

34
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,600
Said She'd Send You
Down Here.

35
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,200
I Know,
That's Why I'm Here.

36
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,400
Because Cuddy Hasn't Found You
Yet.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,300
She's Gonna Look Everywhere

38
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,600
Except The Place
She Wants Me To Be.

39
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:29,900
Hey.

40
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,500
I've Got An Aortic Dissection
Here.

41
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,700
What's With The Idiot?

42
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,600
Fainting Spell And Recent
History Of Dysgeusia.

43
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,600
<I>Everything Tastes
Like Lemon Meringue Pie.</I>

44
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,800
You Want To Take Him?

45
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,700
No.

46
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,000
Sir.

47
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,600
Why Do You Have
Two Lunches In Front Of You?

48
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,100
Been Here For Two Meals.

49
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,200
And You're Happy
With That?

50
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,000
No, I Just Don't See Much Use
In Complaining.

51
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,500
Seriously?

52
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,900
It's A Very Useful Tool.

53
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,000
Complain, You Make People
Miserable.

54
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,000
They Do What You Want
To Make The Misery Go Away.

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,600
You Probably Should
Say Something.

56
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,900
Maybe I Can Call One
Of The Doctors I Work With-

57
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,300
They're Doing
Their Best.

58
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,500
What The Hell?

59
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,600
I'm Sure
It Was An Accident.

60
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,000
Is He Canadian?

61
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,000
Uh, He's A Low Priority...

62
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,800
Is That A Yes?

63
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,400
He's Just-
Happy.

64
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,400
I Gotta Stop This
Before It Spreads.

65
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:39,800
You Guys Are Done.

66
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,600
This Could Be
A Metabolic Disorder,

67
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,100
Toxic Exposure,

68
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,000
Carcinoma Of The Tongue
Metastasized The Brain,

69
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,100
Epilepsy, M.S.

70
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,300
Or It Could Be The Flu,

71
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,500
And We Should All Be
Back In The Er.

72
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,500
No, You're Ignoring

73
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,900
The Big Symptom.

74
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,300
What If We're Looking At Both
The Flu And Decent Parenting?

75
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,600
Okay, You Two
Are Perfectly Healthy.

76
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,200
<I>This Guy Wasn't Pandering.</I>

77
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,500
He Wasn't Vanilla Nice.

78
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,900
He Was Nice
Without Any Aspiration,

79
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,000
<I>Personal Gain.</I>

80
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,600
I'm Thinking
Genetic Defect.

81
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,200
Niceness Is A Defect?

82
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,700
Three Cavemen See A Stranger

83
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,700
Running Towards Them
With A Spear.

84
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,700
One Fights, One Flees,

85
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,900
<I>One Smiles
And Invites Him Over</I>

86
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:21,800
For Fondue.

87
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,100
That Last Guy Didn't Last
Long Enough To Procreate.

88
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,100
And How Long
Has The Patient Been Suffering?

89
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,600
At Least As Long
As His Wife Has Known Him.

90
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,400
11 Years.

91
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,500
The Chances Of Him Having
An Undiagnosed Pathology

92
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,100
- <I>For That Long-
- What Are You Saying?</I>

93
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,500
That Evolution Is Wrong?

94
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,100
Where Do You Think We Are,
21st-Century America?

95
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,800
<I>He's Saying That Statistics</I>

96
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,800
Are True Too.

97
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,300
The World Is A Bell Curve.

98
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,600
<I>Most Of Us Fall
Within The Standard Deviation,</I>

99
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,200
<I>But There Are Outliers,</I>

100
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,300
And If We Believe
In The Existence

101
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,100
Of Extreme Jerkiness,
Which I Suspect That We Do...

102
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,100
Then We Also Have To Accept
The Existence

103
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,400
Of The Opposite Extreme.

104
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,000
you want it to be a symptom

105
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,600
Because Then
We're Supposed To Be Jerks,

106
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,100
<I>Which Means You Don't Even
Have To Try To Be Nice.</I>

107
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,100
Okay.

108
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,400
Maybe I'm Biased.

109
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,400
Let's Take A Vote.

110
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,000
Who Thinks That Niceness
Is Not A Symptom?

111
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,700
And Who Thinks

112
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,600
That Their Vote Counts?

113
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,300
You Two,
Check Out His Home For Toxins.

114
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,400
- <I>Taub And Thirty-One...
- Thirty-One?</I>

115
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:24,900
Oh, I'm Sorry,

116
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,200
I Thought That Either Way
Was Good With You.

117
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,800
Taub And Thirteen,

118
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,500
Mri For Tumors
And Eeg For Nerve Damage.

119
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,700
Test Whatever Comes Out Of Him
For Everything Else.

120
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,200
<I>Too Much Axis Tilt.</I>

121
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,600
Don't Release Until Your Thumb's
At The Bottom Of The Ball.

122
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,400
I Assume Wilson Was Busy.

123
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,500
Again.

124
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,300
No Axis Tilt.

125
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,200
With Amber?

126
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,300
Again.

127
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,000
Still, It Was Nice Of You
To Invite Me.

128
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,200
This Is Fun.

129
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,200
No, It Wasn't.

130
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,400
No, It Isn't.

131
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,800
I Didn't Invite You
To Be Nice.

132
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,600
I Invited You Because Bowling
Isn't One Of The Two Things

133
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,200
Guys Do By Themselves.

134
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
What's The Second Thing?

135
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,600
Other Hand.

136
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,400
<I>If People Are Incapable</I>

137
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,400
Of Being Nice,
Why Bother Having The Word?

138
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,600
The Ontological Proof

139
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,500
<I>Of Niceness.</I>

140
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,100
<I>The Existence Of The Word
Proves The Existence</I>

141
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,200
Of The Concept.

142
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,300
Look Out For Those Minotaurs
On Your Drive Home.

143
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,900
And I Thought Motives
Didn't Matter.

144
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,100
Only Results Mattered.

145
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,500
So What Are You Gonna Do

146
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,000
To Screw Up
Wilson's Relationship

147
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So You Don't Have To Listen
To Me While You Bowl?

148
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,300
I Wish The Best
For Them

149
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,900
And Their Tragically Deformed
Children.

150
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,300
Well, She's Good
At Being Bad.

151
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,500
You Might Not Be Able
To Destroy Her.

152
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,000
As Long As I Give It
My Best Shot.

153
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm Gonna Hold My Head High.

154
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,900
Cameron Had
This One Insufferable Friend.

155
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,000
She Wasn't Gonna Get Rid
Of Her,

156
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And I Sure
Wasn't Gonna Join 'Em.

157
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,000
So I Just Said,
"See Her On Thursdays."

158
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,300
<I>I Know It's Not As Exciting
As An Exploding Birthday Cake,</I>

159
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,900
But, Hell,

160
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,700
I Don't Want To Hang Out
With Her Every Night Anyway.

161
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,200
That's Amazing.

162
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,100
Cameron Only Has
One Insufferable Friend?

163
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,400
Joint Custody.

164
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,200
Of Wilson?

165
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,100
Unless We Have
Another Love Child.

166
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,900
Deal with him.

167
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,900
He Needs
A Mother Figure.

168
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,100
I'm Not Saying
You're Not Entitled

169
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,100
To Spend Time
With Him.

170
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,900
I'm Just Saying
I'm Entitled Too.

171
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,400
I Don't Know How To Deal
With Him

172
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,400
When He's Being Reasonable.

173
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,400
<I>This Is Reasonable?</I>

174
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,500
This Is Crazy.

175
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,500
You're Not A Child.

176
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,900
You Can Make
Your Own Plans.

177
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,300
No, Crazy Is

178
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,100
<I>What House Would Normally Do
In This Situation-</I>

179
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,200
Swap Your Lubricant
With Superglue.

180
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,500
The Man Knows Me.

181
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,900
<I>This Is His Way</I>

182
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,900
Of Accepting Us.

183
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,700
It's Actually
A Very Touching Moment.

184
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,600
I'm Proposing I Get
Every Other Day

185
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,300
And Every Other Weekend.

186
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,200
I Have Yoga Wednesdays.

187
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,400
You Can Have Him Then.

188
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,100
But You Have To Have Him
Home By 11:00.

189
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,700
We Can Swap Weekends.

190
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,100
Mondays And Wednesdays,
And Midnight.

191
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,100
If He's Not Home
Till Midnight,

192
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,600
We Won't Be Asleep
Till Almost 2:00.

193
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,400
Wilson, Make A Ruling.

194
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,800
No.

195
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,300
You Two Are Like Dogs

196
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,000
Circling Each Other
In The Park.

197
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,200
And I Say That
With All The Love In The World.

198
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,600
<I>You Need To Sniff
Each Other's Butts,</I>

199
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,300
<I>Bare Your Teeth, And Arrive
At Some Strange Detente.</I>

200
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,500
Otherwise, You'll End Up
Biting Each Other's Eyes Out.

201
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:18,200
Again, With All The Love
In The World.

202
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,600
I'll Let You Sniff First.

203
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,100
Take My Deal,
Or Get Out Of My Apartment.

204
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,400
Take My Deal,
Or I Move In.

205
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
This Guy Worked
For Habitat For Humanity

206
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
<I>In Costa Rica.</I>

207
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,700
And Coaches
Handicapped Kids.

208
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,800
You Think We Should Do A Work-Up

209
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,800
<I>On The Other Coaches?</I>

210
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,400
It Is Possible
He's Too Perfect.

211
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,700
I'm Not Saying He's Perfect.

212
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,200
I'm Saying
He's Trying To Be.

213
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,400
That's What People Do.

214
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,100
What?

215
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,700
That's Not What People Do.

216
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,800
People Usually Suck,
But They Want To Be Good,

217
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,400
- <I>Want To Be Nice.
- House?</I>

218
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,700
Exception That Proves
The Rule.

219
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,700
What Sort Of Argument
Is That?

220
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,800
A Bad One.

221
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,600
That Might Be Relevant.

222
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,000
Hydrofluoric Acid.

223
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,000
Lowers His Calcium,

224
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,900
Causes The Fainting
And Taste Issue.

225
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,300
But Not The Niceness.

226
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,500
Wouldn't That Be Nice?

227
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,300
You Are King Solomon.

228
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,900
If You Want Us To Cut Him
In Half, We're Cool With That.

229
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,300
My Boyfriend's Too Much
Of A Wuss

230
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,400
To Make The Call For Himself-
And I Mean That

231
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,500
With All The Love
In The World.

232
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,700
I'm Gonna Piss Off
One Of Them,

233
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,800
And They Both Scare Me.

234
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,900
"Your Treatment Of Patients

235
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,100

Let's Go.

242
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,500
No, Why-

243
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,400
I Want To Hear It.

246
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,700
And Covertly.

247
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,100

You Didn't Know About That.

Would Be An Example
Of That.

00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,100
Sign This.

257
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,300
I Will Sign,
If You Will Give Us A Ruling.

258
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,600
I Will Give You A Ruling,

259
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,500
If You Do The Reviews
On Your Team.

260
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,700
I'd Be Happy To Continue
The Mockery Of This Process.

261
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,800
What'd You Offer Him?

262
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:50,800
- Wednesdays Till 11:00 And Alternate Weekends.
- Wednesdays Till 11:00 And Alternate Weekends.

263
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,900
Yes.

264
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,300
Wednesday Nights
Are Ladies' Nights At Cheetah's.

265
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,200
Calcium's Normal.

266
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,000
- Wow.
- It Really Could Wait.

267
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,900
Everything's Normal.

268
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,800
And You Thought
It Wouldn't Be.

269
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,800
He's A Carpet Cleaner.

270
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,600
He's Got A Home
Full Of Hydrofluoric Acid.

271
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,100
That Doesn't Mean His Calcium
Should Be Low.

272
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,400
Yeah, It Actually Kinda Does.
Hf Causes Lower Levels Of-

273
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,800
Lower,
Not Low.

274
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,400
- Lower Than Normal.
- Lower Than Yesterday.

275
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,400
Yesterday Might Have Been High.

276
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,600
What's Lower Than High?

277
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,200
He Actually Has Hypercalcemia,

278
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,000
Which Is Being Lowered To Normal
By The Hf.

279
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,600
So What Gives Us
Elevated Calcium,

280
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,800
Bad Taste,And Fainting?

281
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,800
I Take It
You Know?

282
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,100
Get The Team.

283
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,100
This Is Gonna Be Fun.

284
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,000
Hello, Again.

285
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,700
These People Think
You Are Not Too Nice.

286
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,600
Too Nice?

287
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,000
For What?

288
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
For Life As We Know It

289
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,900
To Have Evolved
Without An Intelligent Designer.

290
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,300
<I>I'm Going To Prove Them
Wrong.</I>

291
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,200
Your Wife Is Very Ugly.

292
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,300
Get Out Of Here.

293
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,300
<I>Deb.</I>

294
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,600
He's Obviously Trying
To Prove A Point.

295
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,500
I Think I Just Did.

296
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,900
<I>You're Either Perfect
Or You're Sick.</I>

297
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,000
In My Experience,
Sick Is Much More Common.

298
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,000
He's Not Sick.

299
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,800
He's Nice.

300
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,500
Nice In The Sense
That Your Toaster Is Nice

301
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,100
<I>For Making You Breakfast.</I>

302
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,100
<I>It's The Only Thing
His Wiring</I>

303
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,000
Will Let Him Do.

304
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,700
He Has Williams Syndrome.

305
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,500
<I>Your Husband Is Missing
The Genes</I>

306
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,700
That Make Him Suspicious.

307
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,700
You're Wrong.

308
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,900
- <I>He's
- Relax, There's No Cure.</I>

309
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,400
<I>He's Gonna Go Right On
Tasting Lemon Meringue Pie,</I>

310
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,200
Fainting,
And Being A Sap.

311
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,100
What About The Other Symptoms?

312
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,600
He Has No Other Symptoms.

313
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,900
But Williams Does.

314
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,500
He's Got Teeth,

315
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,300
Glasses.

316
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,000
Williams Cuts Iq By 20-

317
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
He Doesn't Work
In The Physics Department.

318
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,200
<I>Except When They Spill
A Black Hole On Their Carpet.</I>

319
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,700
Elfin Appearance?

320
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,600
Yeah, He's More Legolas
Than Keebler,

321
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,600
But I Bet You He Can Still Crack
Off A Batch Of Pecan Sandies.

322
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,600
Perfect Pitch?

323
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,700
You Love To Karaoke,
Right?

324
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:44,900
I Suck.

325
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:45,900
Modest.

326
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,100
- <I>Another Symptom.
- No, He Really</I>

327
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,300
Does Suck.

328
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Give Us A Warble.

329
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,300
You Know Any Cher?

330
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,200
No.

331
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,500
But I Know Bread.

332
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,900
What's The Matter?

333
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,200
He's Stroking.

334
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,600
???

335
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,200
<I>You Were Wrong.</I>

336
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,900
Why Do People Say That
With Such Pleasure?

337
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,400
It's Very Hurtful,
You Know.

338
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,200
It Means The Patient Gets
To Keep Being Nice.

339
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,200
Why Does That Offend You?

340
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,700
It's The Way He Said It.

341
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,600
He Wasn't Relieved,
He Was Excited.

342
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,600
He Was Also Wrong.

343
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,000
And I Say That
With No Sense Of Pleasure.

344
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,000
<I>Patient Tested Negative

345

Everything Else Wasn't Caused-

You Have A Friendly Demeanor,

347
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,300
But You Sometimes Get
Too Involved.

348

00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,000
<I>Can Cause
Debilitating Niceness.</I>

356
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,900
How Is That Supposed
To Help Him?

357
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,000
I Don't Know.

358
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,500
How's It Supposed
To Help Wilson?

359
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,300
Cross Out Wilson's Name
And The Date,

360
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,300
<I>And Then Fill In
Your Own Name.</I>

361
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,400
<I>The Point Of A Review</I>

362
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,100
Is To Give Feedback
To Help.

363
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,900
I'm Thinking Neurosyphilis.

364
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,000
<I>Wouldn't Show Up On The Mri</I>

365
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,300
Without Contrast.

366
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,200
I'll Go Run The Tests.

367
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,100
He Doesn't Think
It's Syphilis,

368
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,200
But He's Gonna Go Run
Those Tests Anyway.

369
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,200
Because He Doesn't Know.

370
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,600
That's Why We Do Tests.

371
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,700
<I>Because He's A Wimp.</I>

372
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,200
Because He's Afraid
Of You.

373
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,000
You Want Me To Intimidate Him
Into Not Being Afraid?

374
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,300
Not Sure I Know
How To Do That.

375
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,300
Reviews Make A Difference.

376
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,100
People Have To Listen,
So They Have To Learn.

377
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,300
<I>I Don't Think
That The Right Time</I>

378
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,000
To Tell The Dog Not To Pee
On The Rug

379
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,300
Is Semi-Annually.

380
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,700
You Don't Want To Do
The Paperwork.

381
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,300
I Am Concerned
About The Rainforest.

382
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,600
I'll Do It.

383
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:04,900
I Know.

384
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,200
I Don't Have Syphilis.

385
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,200
You Don't Know.

386
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,300
How Many Ways Are There
To Get It?

387
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,200
You Can Know
Who You Had Sex With.

388
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,400
- <I>You Can't Know Who She-
- I Do.</I>

389
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,500
Not For Sure.

390
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,300
It's A Waste Of Time.

391
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,900
I Had A Stroke.

392
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,800
You Can't Keep Wasting Time.

393
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,900
We Were Tested
For The Peace Corps.

394
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,100
Ten Years Ago.

395
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,700
You Haven't Been With Your Wife
Every Minute Of Every Day.

396
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,900
You Think I'm Naive,
Don't You?

397
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,800
I Think You're-
Yeah.

398
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,300
I Know My Wife.

399
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,600
She's Not Perfect.

400
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,100
I'm Not Perfect.

401
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,400
But She Loves Me.

402
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,700
And She's Always Loved Me.

403
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,400
Every Minute,
Every Day.

404
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,800
You're 15 Minutes Late.

405
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,800
Have You Heard
The Good News?

406
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,600
Miley Cyrus Is Playing

407
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,900
A Third Night
At The Spectrum?

408
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,900
Happiness Is Possible.

409
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,800
And Not Just In This Life,
But In The Next-

410
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,700
Oh, You're Selling
Religion.

411
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,000
I'm Sorry,
I Bought Some Islam Yesterday.

412
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,200
Well, It's Where Your Light
Shows Signs Before Mending-

413
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,500
<I>Have A Good Evening.</I>

414
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,600
You're Late.

415
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,600
15 Minutes.

416
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,600
16 Minutes,
My 16 Minutes.

417
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,000
So Keep Him
An Extra 16 Minutes.

418
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,000
You Hear That?
She Doesn't Care.

419
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,100
You're Going Mini-Golfing.
What's It Matter?

420
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,100
You Got A Tee Off Time?

421
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,300
It Matters
Because You Don't Get

422
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,500
To Decide What Matters.

423
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,800
It Was My Fault.
I Had To Take A Shower.

424
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,500
Which Was My Fault.

425
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,300
I Had To Take A Dump.

426
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:48,900
<I>Anything Else</I>

427
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,200
I Don't Need To Know
Before You Leave?

428
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,500
Have Fun On Your Playdate.

429
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,100
You've Got Mommy's Numbers,
Right?

430
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,600
Daddy Needs A Drink.

431
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,700
I Was Thinking, If We Discount
The Niceness Issue-

432
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,800
Sit Down.

433
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,700
I Think It's A Heart Defect.

434
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,900
Nothing On The Echo.

435
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,200
Could Be
A Patent Foramen Ovale.

436
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,000
It Explains The Stroke,

437
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,800
And The Syncope,
And A Pfo Wouldn't Show Up

438
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,800
On A Routine Echo.

439
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,600
I'm Gonna Do A Bubble Test.

440
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,900
You Got A Minute First?

441
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,800
Sure.

442
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,500
I Think You've Shown
Remarkable Strength

443
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,600
In A Difficult Situation.

444
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,700
Are You Giving Me
A Performance Review?

445
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,000
A Good One.

446
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,000
I'm Gonna Do A Bubble Test.

447
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,700
<I>There Was Enough Blood
Left Over</I>

448
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,900
From His Admission Work-Up
To Run The Vdrl.

449
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,000
You Doubted Your Patient.

450
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,100
No, What I Thought
Didn't Matter.

451
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,800
House Said He Wouldn't Let Us
Go On

452
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,200
Until We Ruled Out
Neurosyphilis.

453
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,300
It's Not Neurosyphilis;
It's A Pfo.

454
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,900
It's Neurosyphilis.

455
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,700
The Tests Were Positive.

456
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,800
It's Always
The Same Conversation.

457
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,000
They Tell You
You Must Be Mistaken,

458
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,400
Which Is Why I Always Run
The Tests Twice,

459
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,500
And Then They Blame
The Other Guy,

460
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,200
Which Makes Sense
If They're Innocent,

461
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,800
But Obviously,
Half Of 'Em Aren't.

462
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,200
They Don't Seem To Get
That They're Busted.

463
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,900
Scientifically Proven.

464
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,800
Unless Your Spouse
Cheated Too.

465
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:19,500
Exactly.

466
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,000
That's What You're Praying For
In That Moment.

467
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,900
That She Cheated Too.

468
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,900
And Then If She Doesn't Kill
You, You Know That She Did.

469
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,400
You Know
She Betrayed You.

470
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,500
And Then, You Realize
That That Sucks Worse.

471
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,300
The Test Must Be Wrong.

472
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,600
I Ran It Twice.

473
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,600
Not That Test.

474
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,800
The One I Took Ten Years Ago.

475
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,800
What Other Explanation
Is There?

476
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,600
He Really Sees
No Other Possibility.

477
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,600
Did You Have An Affair?

478
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,300
No.

479
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,900
Then Why Aren't You Angry
With Him?

480
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,000
You Ever Know Anybody
Who's Just Too Nice?

481
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,000
No.

482
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,800
It's Annoying-
Then You Realize

483
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,300
It's Annoying Because They
Remind You Of What You Are Not.

484
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,400
That You'll Never Be
As Good As They Are.

485
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,500
And Then You Think,
Why Can't I?

486
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,600
And Before You Know It,

487
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,200
That Naive Idiot
You Laughed At

488
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,500
Has Made You
A Better Person.

489
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,100
You Really Think

490
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,200
I've Been In Love
All These Years With A Symptom?

491
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,400
If Syphilis Caused
Lesions In His Brain,

492
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,700
<I>And The Lesions Caused
Personality Changes,</I>

493
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,000
You May Notice A Change In Him
As His Condition Improves.

494
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,200
I Know My Husband.
He's Not Gonna Change.

495
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,600
You Should Get Yourself
Tested.

496
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,400
So Much For The Bell Curve.

497
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,200
How Can House Be An Ass
Without It Being An Illness,

498
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,700
But Niceness
Is A Biological Crime?

499
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,800
You Got Five Bucks?

500
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,300
Uh, Yeah.

501
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,600
Niceness Just Cost You
Five Bucks.

502
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,800
Being An Ass
Generally Turns A Profit.

503
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,500
Kutner, Could You Excuse Us?

504
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,300
I Need To Do
Taub's Review.

505
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,800
You Can Stay.

506
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,000
I Think It Would Be Better
If This Was Done Privately.

507
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,400
This Isn't Gonna Be Done.

508
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,300
What Is It With You Guys?

509
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,600
I've Given You Advice Before.

510
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,800
Not As Our Boss.

511
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,100
What's The Difference?
Advice Is Advice.

512
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,200
Fair Enough.
I'll Go First.

513
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,100
You Demonstrate A Great Air
Of Confidence,

514
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,600
Which Is Really
Pissing Me Off.

515
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,300
House Authorized Me-

516
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,100
How Long Have You Known Him?
He's Using You.

517
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,400
I Volunteered
Because I Knew He Wouldn't.

518
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,600
He Could Care Less
About The Paperwork.

519
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,500
He's Using You
To Screw With You.

520
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,900
He Knows
It'll Annoy Us.

521
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,800
We'll Stand Up
To You,

522
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,300
Which Will Force You
To Confront The Fact

523
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,800
That Even Though You Think
You're Our Superior,

524
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,000
You're No Different
From Us.

525
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,400
<I>He Gave You Authority</I>

526
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,500
To Keep You
In Your Place.

527
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,800
It's True.

528
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,300
Thanks.

529
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,100
Not Him,
What'd He Say?

530
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,500
Nothing,
What's True?

531
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,100
There's Something
Wrong With This Guy,

532
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,000
It Means There's Something Wrong
With House.

533
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,600
Are You Trying
To Get Me Drunk?

534
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,200
What Time Is It?

535
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,200
10:30.

536
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,300
Ooh.
She'll Kill You.

537
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,300
I'll Get You Home
Before Lights Out.

538
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,600
Great.

539
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,100
Then She'll Kill Me.

540
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,700
If I Get-
If I Get Any More Drunk,

541
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,400
Then I'm-

542
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,500
It...

543
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,800
Might Not Work.

544
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,000
If You, Uh,
Know What I Mean.

545
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,500
Really?

546
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,600
You'd Think That One Or More
Of Your Ex-Wives

547
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,100
Would Have Mentioned That
To Me.

548
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,800
They Told You?

549
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,600
<I>Wait.</I>

550
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,100
Why Do You Want To Get
Amber Angry?

551
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,700
Because I'm Your Friend.

552
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,300
No, No, No.

553
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,800
You Said You Approved,
You Said You Were Taking-

554
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,800
The High Road.

555
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,400
For How Long,
The First Exit?

556
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,900
Hello, And Thank You
For Saving Me

557
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,500
From Being Righteoused
To Death.

558
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,000
<I>Patient's Vomiting Blood.</I>

559
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,200
Hematemesis Could Indicate-

560
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,900
<I>Don't Put It On The Board.</I>

561
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,600
You Don't Think
It's A Symptom?

562
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,400
I Think
It's My Marker.

563
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,900
<I>He Has Syph.</I>

564
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,500
And What?

565
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,900
And Syph,
It Can Cause Hematemesis.

566
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,600
<I>Not Everyone Agrees.</I>

567
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,400
How-How Could You-

568
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,600
You Wouldn't Have Woken Me Up
In The Middle Of The Night.

569
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,500
If It Was Just Syph,
He Wouldn't Be Getting Worse.

570
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,700
<I>He's Already On Penicillin.</I>

571
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,500
<I>Bleeding's Probably</I>

572
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,000
From Liver Damage,
Probably Caused By Ethanol

573
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,100
In The Cleansers
Or The Penicillin.

574
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,700
Two More Probablys
Than I Like To Hear.

575
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,600
Liver Tests And Serologies
Are Gonna Take A Full Day.

576
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,200
Full Night,
Actually.

577
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,200
<I>Guy Not Might Make It
To Brunch.</I>

578
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,300
Yes, I Knew About Your Issue
With Alcohol.

579
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,900
<I>Yes, I Intentionally</I>

580
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,600
Got You Drunk To Provoke An
Argument Between You And Amber.

581
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,900
Why I Would Do
Such A Thing

582
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,300
Is An Interesting Question.

583
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,500
What's More Interesting

584
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,400
<I>Is That You Knew
As Much As I Did</I>

585
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,800
And You're The One
Who's Pouring Down The Drinks.

586
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,300
Why?

587
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,200
Because I Thought I Was Out
Having Fun With A Friend.

588
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,900
I Didn't Know
The Drinks Had Subtext.

589
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,200
I Gotta Get Home.

590
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,200
Ggt's Normal.

591
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,500
Rules Out Alcohol.

592
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,000
How About Serum Protein?

593
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,400
It's Positive.

594
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,200
Kinda Assumed He Had Protein.

595
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,300
It's How Much Protein He Has
We Care About.

596
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,900
It's Positive
For Syphilis.

597
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,800
You Mind If I Give You
A Performance Review?

598
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,700
Not The Patient.

599
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,100
House.

600
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,600
He Has Syphilis.

601
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,900
What Happened?

602
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,600
Every Time I Searched
My Soul...

603
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,400
I Found Anna.

604
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,400
Are You Gonna Tell Marie?

605
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,700
I Have To.

606
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,900
<I>It Will Destroy Her.</I>

607
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,900
<I>Could It Be Any Worse
On Her</I>

608
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,200
Than Loving Somebody
Who Can't Love Them Back?

609
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,300
Yes?

610
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
You Might Want
To Turn Off The Tv.

611
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,800
Don't You Think I Know That?
I'm Multi-Tasking.

612
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,400
Also Doing My Taxes.

613
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,800
And Cuddy.

614
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,100
What'd You Find Out?

615
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,100
The Patient Has Hepatitis.

616
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,500
<I>I Assume From Your Omission
Of The Word 'Viral'</I>

617
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,300
Before The Hep
That It's Not Another Std.

618
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,100
Put Him On Steroids
And Test Him For Sarcoid

619
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:17,300
Before The Liver Failure
Becomes Liver Failed.

620
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,700
We're All Doing This.

621
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,800
There's More?

622
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,800
You Have Syphilis.

623
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,300
No, I Don't.

624
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,300
One Of Us Found A Vial
Of Your Blood In The Lab-

625
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,800
Which One Of You?

626
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,500
It's Treatable.

627
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,200
We Filled A Prescription.

628
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,000
You Okay?

629
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,300
So This Is Why He Is
Who He Is.

630
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,400
We Don't Know.

631
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,200
<I>We Know.</I>

632
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,100
It's Not Just A Coincidence.

633
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,800
Wilson Says
He's Always Been A Jerk.

634
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,100
But He Got Worse.

635
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,200
After His Leg.

636
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,100
The Leg Was
A Coincidence.

637
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,600
Did You Sleep
With Him?

638
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,800
So What's Gonna Happen?

639
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,100
What's Gonna Change?

640
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,500
Maybe He'll Be Less
Of A Jerk.

641
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,100
Or Less Of A Doctor.

642
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,600
You Gotta Be A Jerk
To Be A Good Doctor?

643
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,300
I Don't Know.
Maybe House Does.

644
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,000
Why Aren't You Answering Me?

645
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,800
Because It's None
Of Their Business.

646
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,600
It's None Of Your Business.

647
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,800
I Think The Std
Makes It My Business.

648
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,500
Humans Are Complicated.

649
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,800
Humans Are Simple.

650
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,800
<I>A Million Different Things</I>

651
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,600
Make Us Who We Are.

652
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,800
You Change One,
You Change Everything.

653
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,100
If Mozart Was Better Adjusted,

654
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,600
Decides To Play Catch One Day,

655
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,300
<I>Maybe There's No Magic Flute.</I>

656
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,600
You Did, Didn't You?

657
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,000
There's Something
I Need To Tell You.

658
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,000
<I>You Returned Him Drunk.</I>

659
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,800
On Time.

660
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,100
Drunk.
On Time.

661
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:34,800
No Tag Backs.

662
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,300
The Purpose Of The Time
Was To Give Me Time.

663
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,500
So You Didn't Have Sex?

664
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,400
I Like Sex.

665
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,600
Then You Can Have It
Tonight.

666
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,300
<I>The L Word Is On.</I>

667
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,200
You Don't Get To Decide
What Matters.

668
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,500
Either You're Genuinely Afraid

669
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,300
I'm Gonna Make Him
Miserable,

670
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,600
Or You're Afraid
I'm Gonna Make Him Happy,

671
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,200
<I>Or You Simply Can't Stop
Screwing</I>

672
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,800
With Anything That Moves-
It Doesn't Really Matter

673
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,500
Because Whatever The Reason,
You'll Only Get Worse.

674
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,800
Until Either I Stop Seeing
Wilson,

675
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,000
Or I Stop You.

676
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,300
What Do You Think
I'm Gonna Choose?

677
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,900
If You Terminate
The Agreement,

678
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,400
It's Not Gonna Bring Peace
In The Mideast.

679
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,600
I'm Not Terminating
The Agreement.

680
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,700
I'm Amending
The Agreement.

681
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,400
I'm Adding Penaltylaus C.

682
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,600
Fine.

683
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,000
Whoever Violates It
Gets Their Finger Cut Off.

684
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,800
I'm Serious.
So Am I.

685
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,000
You Want People
To Drive Safer,

686
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Take Out The Airbags

687
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,400
And Attach A Machete
Pointing At Their Neck.

688
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,700
No One Will Drive
Over Three Miles Per Hour.

689
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,200
I'm Not Cutting-
We'll Figure It Out.

690
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,600
On Your Time.

691
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,800
You Know She's Certifiable,
Right?

692
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,900
I Got The Forms
In My Desk.

693
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,000
Where Is She Wrong?

694
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,300
<I>What Were You Gonna
Tell Me?</I>

695
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,900
Nothing.

696
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,900
You're Punishing Me?

697
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,800
I Needed To Tell You Something
Privately.

698
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,000
I'm Not Gonna Tell Her.

699
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,200
You'll Tell Her.

700
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,500
She's Your Girlfriend.

701
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,900
You Should Tell Her.
You're My Friend.

702
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,300
It's Not The Same.

703
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,400
Don't Sulk.

704
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,400
Where Am I Wrong?

705
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,900
<I>Your Management Style
Is Counterproductive.</I>

706
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,600
You Gave Me Authority
Over The Team,

707
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,700
Just So They Could Undercut-

708
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,800
Critiquing The Clap-Addled?

709
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,000
That's Sort Of Tasteless.

710
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I Didn't Feel Like Waiting
Until Your Genitals Cleared Up.

711
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
<I>You Need To Formalize</I>

712
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,400
My Authority Over The Team.

713
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,600
No, I Don't.

714
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,200
You Don't Think I'm Qualified?

715
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,300
Compared To Those Three?

716
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,200
You Wanna Punish Cuddy
For Hiring Me Without-

717
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,500
I Like Cuddy.

718
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,300
I Like Parts Of Her.

719
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
You Wanna Crush The Team
By Crushing Me?

720
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,800
I Want To Empower Them.

721
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,800
Those Three Idiots
Need To Respect You.

722
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,300
<I>They Should Respect You.</I>

723
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,000
<I>They Should Be Afraid
Of You.</I>

724
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,200
So I Have To Humiliate You.

725
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,200
<I>'Cause If The Team Fears You,</I>

726
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,700
They Won't Question You;
If They Don't Question You,

727
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,800
They Won't Get Any Answers;
If They Don't Get Any Answers,

728
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,000
They're Useless.

729
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,500
Mocking Me Saves Lives?

730
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,400
The Hospital Will Probably
Build You A Statue One Day.

731
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,600
You Know, With A "Kick Me" Sign
On The Back.

732
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,600
<I>So When You Think About It,</I>

733
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,300
The More I Mock You,

734
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,100
The More It Shows I Have Respect
For You.

735
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:25,500
Or You Made Up That B.S.
Because You Like Humiliating Me.

736
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,000
Wouldn't Rule That Out
Completely.

737
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,800
<I>You Busy?
Almost Done.</I>

738
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:35,000
Uh, So Just Remember,
The Rabbit Goes Around The Tree

739
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,600
And Jumps Down The Hole.

740
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,300
Negative For Sarcoidosis.

741
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,700
Run Him For Everything
You Can Think Of.

742
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,900
Lepto, Schisto, Hemo,

743
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,900
And The Fourth Marx Brother
Nobody Ever Heard Of.

744
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,200
You Bitch!

745
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,900
<I>I Just Went To Get Us
Some Lunch,</I>

746
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,700
You Were Asleep.

747
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,400
You Moved My Book.

748
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,300
Jeff.

749
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,200
Calm Down.

750
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,300
It's Just The Drugs.

751
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,400
The Drugs Didn't Move My Book-

752
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,900
Jeff?

753
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,500
My Husband's Having A Heart Attack-
Can Somebody Help Me,

754
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,700
<I>Please?</I>

755
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,700
Somebody Help Me,

756
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,000
Please!

757
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,700
She Saved His Life.

758
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,100
Or She Scabbed.

759
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,900
Depends On Your Point Of View.

760
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,600
<I>So What Do We Think?</I>

761
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,600
New Symptom?

762
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,700
Or Just A Wife Beater?

763
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,800
Hey.

764
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,000
Time For You To Take
This Baby For A Spin.

765
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,300
We, Uh, Loaded Him
Full Of Prednisone

766
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,800
<I>To Try To Fix The Liver.</I>

767
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:51,000
Good News Is, He's Running Out
Of Organs To Fail.

768
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,900
Prednisone Could Cause

769
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,500
'Roid Rage, Which Could Cause
Hypertension,

770
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,200
<I>Which Results
- 'Roid Rage After Six Hours?</I>

771
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,000
At That Rate, By Sundown,
He'll Have Eaten Most Of Us.

772
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,900
Uh, It Still Could Be
Penicillin.

773
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,800
<I>Allergic Reaction.</I>

774
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,200
How Does A Fried Liver
Put Him Into A Rage?

775
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,800
It's Not Frying His Liver,
It's Frying His Syphilis.

776
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,000
<I>The Penicillin's Working.</I>

777
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,500
<I>The Real Patient Is Emerging,</I>

778
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:17,200
So Syphilis Prevents
Domestic Violence.

779
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,700
I'm Gonna Be
More Attractive To The Ladies.

780
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,000
I Was Gonna Test
For A Heart Issue

781
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,200
<I>Before The Syphilis.</I>

782
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,700
<I>Pfo Could Explain
The Heart Attack</I>

783
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,400
And Reduced Blood Flow To The
Brain Could Explain The Rage.

784
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,400
Well, All Good Ideas.

785
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,900
<I>Okay,Let's Take A Vote.</I>

786
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,200
How Many Think
It's The 'Roids Talking?

787
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,600
And Who's For The Penicillin?

788
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
<I>And How About</I>

789
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,400
Whatever She Said?

790
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,800
Someone Hasn't Raised
Their Hand.

791
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,000
Whatever I Decide?

792
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,000
You're Setting Me Up.

793
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,400
Why Would I Do That?

794
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,600
Pfo.

795
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,100
The Pfos Have It.

796
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,900
I Just Hope The Bubble Test
Is Positive.

797
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,800
Or It's No More
Mr. Nice Guy.

798
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,700
We Gave Van Gogh
Chelation Therapy.

799
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,500
Turned Him
Into A House Painter.

800
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,400
<I>Maybe Not.</I>

801
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,800
<I>Maybe We Just</I>

802
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,900
Put Hitler On Ritalin.

803
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,300
Are You Comparing House
To Hitler?

804
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,600
Oh God.

805
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,700
Just Because I Don't Think
He's Hitler

806
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,600
Doesn't Mean I Slept
With Him.

807
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,700
I Don't Sleep With Everyone
Who's Better Than Hitler.

808
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,400
Maybe Taub Is Right.

809
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,100
Maybe This Is Good.

810
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,400
This Is Not Good.

811
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,500
Well, He Respected
Our Opinions,

812
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,600
<I>He Mocked Himself,</I>

813
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,300
<I>He Was Civil,
He Shared.</I>

814
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,800
He Didn't Care.

815
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,900
He Never Cares.

816
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,400
He Didn't Vote.

817
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,400
<I>He Always Cared
About One Thing.</I>

818
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,900
Solving The Puzzle.

819
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,800
But He Was Irrelevant
To That Diagnosis.

820
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,800
He Had No Opinion
Of His Own.

821
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,400
He Now Cares About Nothing.

822
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,600
You Had No Choice;
You Had To Treat Him.

823
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,700
What's Done Is Done.

824
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,700
You Know That Thing
I Was Gonna Tell You,

825
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,900
I Gotta Tell You.

826
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,000
I Gotta Tell
Someone.

827
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,100
You've Got To Swear
Not To Tell C.B.

828
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,100
Whatever.

829
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,000
Well, That's Not Swearing,
That's Shrugging.

830
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,800
It's Actually The Opposite
Of Swearing.

831
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,100
I Won't Tell Amber.

832
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:40,000
My Team Thinks
That I Have Syphilis.

833
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,300
Do You?

834
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,500
Not Yet.

835
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,900
Why Do They Think
You Do?

836
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,700
Because I Knew

837
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,500
That They Had Access
To An Old Blood Sample,

838
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,800
And I Knew They'd Test It
Sometime For Something.

839
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,200
Why Would You Swap Your Blood?

840
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,300
What Are You Afraid
They'll Find?

841
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,700
Shut Up,
You're Missing The Point.

842
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,800
Now, They Think
That I'm On Penicillin.

843
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,100
Is This
Some Clever Practical Joke

844
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:00,800
That I'm Not Aware Of?

845
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,000
And As I Get Better,
I Get Nicer.

846
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,100
That's Brilliant.

847
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,500
Foreman Thinks
I Actually Value His Opinion.

848
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,900
Thank God He Said Pfo, Or I'd
Have Had To Do Some Dancing.

849
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,900
You Got Time For Bowling?

850
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,300
Come On,
It's Work Hours.

851
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,400
I'll Get My Shoes.

852
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,800
So We Don't Need To Talk About
- No.

853
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,700
You're Gonna Keep Screwing-
Yeah.

854
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,600
You're Gonna Keep Talking
About It.

855
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,900
We Are Who We Are.

856
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,600
I'll Get My Shoes.

857
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,800
Okay, Got A Good View
Of The Heart.

858
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,500
What If We Lower
House's Dosage?

859
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,900
Maybe Stabilize Him,

860
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,800
He Doesn't Get Worse,

861
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,900
He Doesn't Get Better.

862
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,000
Quite The Line To Walk.

863
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,300
If We're Wrong,
He Dies Of Neurosyphilis.

864
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,900
If We Don't,
Other People Die.

865
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,100
Other People Who Aren't
Our Boss.

866
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,000
People.

867
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,600
This Sucks.

868
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,500
The Guy Had A Gift.
I'd Kill-

869
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,100
Hi, What-

870
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,900
House Doesn't Have Syphilis.

871
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,600
He Switched
The Blood Samples.

872
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,600
How Do You Know That?

873
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,800
House Told Wilson.
I Wanted To Ruin House's Day.

874
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,300
See Ya.

875
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
We're Idiots.

876
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,800
We're Not Idiots.

877
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,500
Positive Blood Test Means
Positive Blood Test.

878
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,000
Apparently Not.

879
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,800
There They Are,
Let's See If They-

880
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,100
Uh, What Are You Doing?
We're Not Done.

881
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,700
He Doesn't Have Syphilis.

882
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,900
I Know.

883
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,900
<I>Patient Tested Positive
For Syphilis, Right?</I>

884
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,400
Is This Some Sort
Of Recap?

885
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,800
But Why Did He Test Positive

886
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,000
For Syphilis?

887
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,500
Oh, I Know This.

888
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,900
????
He Has Syphilis-

889
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:50,700
I Was Gonna Say That.

890
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,200
The Test
Was Wrong Twice,

891
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,900
Or Three, He Gave Us
Someone Else's Blood.

892
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,800
Who?

893
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,000
Amber.

894
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,400
Get That Idiotic Smile

895
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,800
Out Of My Face.

896
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,700
I Gotta Go
On A Killing Spree.

897
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:15,600
Or, Four, He Has Something That
Tests Positive For Syphilis.

898
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,700
It's Not Chagas.

899
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,000
He Worked In Costa Rica
Before He Was Married.

900
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,700
Is Two A Spree,
Or Do I Have To Kill You Too?

901
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,600
Chagas Wouldn't Explain
The Niceness.

902
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,800
I've Heard Of Remote Tribes
That Actually Practice

903
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,300
Acts Of Kindness.

904
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,900
Or The Chagas Caused
Encephalitis.

905
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,200
The Mri Showed No Sign-

906
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,600
Until We Started Him
On Steroids,

907
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,000
Compromised The Immune System,

908
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,600
And Let The Infection
Flare Up.

909
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,900
I Did Another One.

910
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,900
It's Not Much.

911
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,400
It's Plenty.

912
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,200
You Figured This Out
Because I Don't Have Syphilis?

913
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,900
Damn.

914
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,400
That Should Have Been
My Epiphany.

915
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,700
Good News, Bad News.

916
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,300
<I>Good News Is</I>

917
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,600
We Know What You Have,

918
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,700
It's Treatable,
You're Gonna Live.

919
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,400
Really?

920
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,200
What's The Bad News?

921
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,200
The Cure Is A Grueling Course
Of Pills.

922
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,900
It's Like One A Day
For A Month.

923
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,300
Now You're Just
Trying To Make Me Laugh.

924
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,300
Yeah, Like That's A Challenge.

925
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,100
You Have Chagas Disease.

926
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,300
It's A Parasite.

927
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,300
<I>It's Been Asymptomatic
For Ten Years.</I>

928
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,000
Not Quite.

929
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,300
Your Brain's Been Swollen-
Not Enough To See,

930
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,300
<I>But Enough To Alter
Your Personality.</I>

931
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,300
Now We're Back
To That.

932
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,400
He Screamed
At You.

933
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,800
You Don't Think
He Could Change?

934
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,600
That Was Because
Of The Drugs.

935
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,900
So You Think Drugs Are More
Powerful Than Parasites?

936
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:46,900
<I>I Mean, </I>

937
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,900
The Ones We're Gonna Give You To Treat
The Parasites Obviously Are-

938
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,900
I Stand
By The Principle.

939
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,900
I'm Not Worried.

940
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,700
Neither Am I.

941
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,200
Neither Am I.

942
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,900
But That's Because
I Don't Care.

943
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Reviews?

944
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,100
<I>It Was Brought
To My Attention</I>

945
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,600
That On Occasion,
I Am Not Respectful

946
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,000
Of Hospital Hierarchy.

947
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,900
<I>The Word Was "Contemptuous."</I>

948
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,500
Well-Phrased,
Thoughtful.

949
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,900
Identically Phrased.

950
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,800
These Are All The Same.

951
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,900
Because, Underneath It All,
We Are All The Same.

952
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,300
And Foreman Refused
To Type His Up.

953
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,700
Well, It's More
Than I Expected.

954
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,600
There's An Extra One
In There.

955
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:12,100
"Your Treatment Of Patients
Is Non-Existent

956
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:15,900
Because You're Not A Doctor,
You're An Administrator."

957
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,100
Foreman Convinced Me
That These Could Be Helpful.

958
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,000
<I>"Your Management Of Employees</I>

959
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,100
Is, Well, Let's Face It,
They're Outside Carrying Signs."

960
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,600
The Strike Ended.

961
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,700
<I>The Nurses Have Been Back
For Two Shifts Already.</I>

962
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,100
You'd Think I'd Have Noticed.

963
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,200
What Exactly Did They Do
Around Here?

964
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,600
"You Act Like Employees

965
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,600
<I>"Should Fear And Respect You,
But Your Eyes Tell Us-</I>

966
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,600
"But Your Eyes Tell Us Nothing

967
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,200
"Because We're Looking
At Your Boobs,

<I>"Which Tell Us
That You're Desperate</I>

969
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,500
"To Have Someone Jump On You
And Tell You They Love You

970
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,000
"One Grunted Syllable

972
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,400
<I>"What You Need,</I>

973
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,700
"You Don't Have A Clue.

00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,800
"What You've Accomplished,

00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,300
But You're Still Miserable."

976
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,600
Please Sign.

977
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,400
I Got A Call
From Amber Today.

978
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,500
Says There's Been
A Violation Of Your Contract.

979
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,600
You've Been Seeing Wilson
On Her Time.

980
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,100
She Breached Confidentiality.

981
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,900
You Can Let It Slide,
Officer.

982
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,200
We're Even.

983
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,100
Yes, You Are.

984
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,100
You're Both Losing Fingers.

985
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,600
Look What I Found.

986
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,000
Nice.

987
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,500
They Think You Might Be Able
To Come Home Tomorrow.

988
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,700
Oh, Yeah?
That's Good.

989
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,000
What's The Matter?

990
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,300
The Ketchup.

991
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,500
There's Something Wrong
With That.

992
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,500
Tastes Fine.

993
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:49,900
Anything Else?

994
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,700
Everything Else Is Great.

995
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,700
I'm Just-
I Don't Know.

996
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,700
I Guess I Don't Like
Ketchup Anymore.

997
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,500
Wonder What Else
I Don't Like.

998
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,900
Roll Over.

999
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,900
We Need
A Tougher Punishment.

1000
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,600
Come Over
To The Poopy Side.

1001
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,000
Where Are You Two Going
Friday Night?

1002
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,100
Dinner At L'auberge.

1003
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,000
You're Lying.

1004
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,500
Of Course I Am.
