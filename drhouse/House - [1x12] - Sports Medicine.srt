1
00:00:03,236 --> 00:00:04,931
Are you thinkin' about taking drugs?

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:08,941
Well, think again,
because drugs are not the answer.

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,000
Take it from me, Hank Wiggen.

4
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:14,238
Oh, don't remember this ugly mug?

5
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:19,851
Two years ago, I was a star.
I won n-nine games in a row.

6
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:23,548
- But by the end of August, I was gone--
- Cut! Cut!

7
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:30,461
- Not good, huh?
- Well, you caught the ball.

8
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,088
Yeah.

9
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:37,865
Look, I usually don't, you know,
give line readings, but let me-- Try this.

10
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:39,905
Hollywood ain't holdin' its breath.

11
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:43,136
Yeah, well, they're doin' it wrong.
I mean, for Hank.

12
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,439
Tell the director.

13
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:49,505
I thought I'd give the marriage a few months
before I go for the meddling wife thing.

14
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:53,040
His arm came back the day after
you hooked up. I say meddle.

15
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:55,713
You okay?
Just gas.

16
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:59,247
Go help your man. Give me
a little room here to work it out.

17
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:11,165
Take it from me, Hank Wiggen.

18
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,795
Like that?
No.

19
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:14,863
Hey, sweetheart.
Hey.

20
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,365
Hi, Bryan.
Hey.

21
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:20,777
Having trouble with the big speech?
Yeah. You got any ideas?

22
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:23,407
It's your story.
Just be yourself.

23
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:26,941
Drugs were there, you took 'em.
Simple.

24
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,251
Why'd you get clean?
'Cause I was gonna die.

25
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:32,518
And, come April,
'cause you're clean,

26
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:35,857
you're starting Opening Day
against the Yanks.

27
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:40,730
Try it her way?
Yeah.

28
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,734
Okay. Okay.

29
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:47,330
Let's start with the second part first.
That'll get him in the groove.
Okay.

30
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:49,398
We'll do the throwing thing first.

31
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:51,467
Everybody wants to direct.

32
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,475
- Warner all right?
- Yeah, he's good.

33
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:59,143
You just bring it, babe.
Just tell your story.

34
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,312
Roll cameras.

35
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:03,355
Rolling.
Sound. Speed.

36
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:06,620
Come on, kid! Show 'em
what you're gonna give the Yankees!

37
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:08,354
All right, action!

38
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,805
Oh, God!

39
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:37,518
You okay?
It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.

40
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:31,475
He's got osteopenia. His bones
are too thin to fix the arm problem.

41
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:35,480
No. Price is not a problem
if you have what I need.

42
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,982
Young man?
How did you know?

43
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,918
Well, if he's an old man,
osteopenia would just be a fact of life.

44
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:43,820
You make him comfortable, send him home,
which means you're just boring me.

45
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,381
So he's young, which means
it's most likely caused by cancer.

46
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:49,622
You're here because you haven't found it.
Have you looked really, really hard?

47
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:52,164
M.R.I. and PET scan
are both negative.

48
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,065
Well, how old is he?
Maybe the osteopenia is just early onset.

49
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:57,534
Ah, let's see.

50
00:03:57,604 --> 00:04:00,630
"Born 9/21 /77".

51
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:02,197
It's Hank Wiggen?

52
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:05,971
And he signed it. Sweet.
Yeah.

53
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:10,038
"To Jimmy Wilson,
the Cy Young of medicine".

54
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:13,108
Did you ask for that?
Just the "Jimmy" part.

55
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:18,346
The bone's too thin to support the kind
of surgery that would let him pitch again.

56
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,551
But if we figure out
what's causing the osteopenia,

57
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,618
we can reverse the bone damage,
then do the surgery.

58
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:26,187
Beat the Yankees
and save the free world.

59
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,038
It was a working dinner.

60
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,939
My work-- Company pays.

61
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:41,606
I don't know. I just feel kind of weird
after what it turned into.

62
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:44,775
Well, then it stopped being work.

63
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:48,184
You know, if it'll solve
your ethics problem,

64
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:51,156
you can reimburse me for these.

65
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:53,954
What are they, $5.57, I believe?

66
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:02,061
Mmm.
Let me know about Friday?

67
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:05,366
- Yeah.
- Mmm.

68
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,893
None of the usual suspects.

69
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:31,259
Age isn't right, in apparent
perfect health before this incident,

70
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,926
M.R.I. and PET scan negative for tumors.
Test him again.
It's gotta be cancer.

71
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:38,061
Sorry I'm late.
Car broke down on the interstate.

72
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:43,874
Don't believe you.
CHEM-7 shows a poor kidney function.

73
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:46,776
- Why would a guy in his 20s
have a poor kidney function?
- Cancer.

74
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,906
It first attacks the bones,
and then the kidneys.

75
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:54,919
Come on, people.
He was 17 and 7. His E.R.A. was 2.1.

76
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:59,219
You want it to be his kidneys,
because if it's his kidneys,
then maybe we can treat it, fix it.

77
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:02,125
And if it's cancer,
then he'll never pitch again.

78
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:06,188
If this were a regular guy
who broke his arm lifting a box,
you would've sent him home.

79
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:09,928
My God, you're right. I lost my head.
All life is equally sacred.

80
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:14,564
I promise you. The next knitting injury
that comes in here, we're on it
like stink on cheese.

81
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,736
- He weighed 175 his rookie year.
- Stop.

82
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:20,904
Now he's 195
after playing a year in Japan.

83
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,914
Why?
He let himself go.

84
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:27,749
Steroids. The guy was a drug user.
I'm sure he wouldn't have balked
at pumping up through chemicals.

85
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,084
That'd explain the weight gain
and the kidney problems.

86
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:32,989
And the bone loss.
Go ask him what he's on.

87
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:36,153
When he says nothing,
have him pee in a cup.

88
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:43,435
If your car breaks down,
you're an hour late, not two minutes.

89
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:47,132
And two minutes isn't late enough
to use a clever excuse like car trouble.

90
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:49,674
I was coming in early.
Huh.

91
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,404
Unprompted lies.
That's a bad sign.

92
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:56,778
Either a guilty conscience,
or something personal's going on.

93
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:04,519
See, that's all you had to do--
just walk in, sit down, do your job.

94
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,961
No. No, I never took 'em.

95
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:14,122
We're gonna need a urine sample.

96
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,101
Oh, no, you don't trust me.

97
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:22,697
Baby, I'm worried about
takin' this morphine.

98
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,265
You're in pain.

99
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:27,437
The doses are monitored.
It's not a slip.

100
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:29,504
Besides, opiates weren't your thing.

101
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:32,551
They should've been.
Whoa.

102
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,848
Mr. Wiggen? The urine sample.

103
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:39,983
I wanna say no, so I am-- no.

104
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:44,723
Trust is a big issue in early recovery.
He really did gain the weight honestly.

105
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,695
If you say so.

106
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:50,565
You're not gettin' it.

107
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:55,033
He thinks I'm an idiot.

108
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:58,266
He sure does.

109
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:07,580
Should we save a sample?

110
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:11,350
Dr. Sports Fan can put it in Lucite
and hang it around his neck.

111
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,116
Hey, Friday night,
can you cover for me?

112
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:17,594
I think so.

113
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:21,565
Oh, Friday. No, I'm sorry. I have to go
to that oncology thing, the seminar.

114
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:24,000
Oh.
What's goin' on?

115
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,004
Dinner with the drug rep.

116
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:28,006
Castine Pharmaceuticals.

117
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:31,840
Arnie?
Claims he has 500 lawyer jokes,
only tells one?

118
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:34,812
Uh... new guy.

119
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,074
You need cash?

120
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:44,113
No, I-- I don't have that much on me.

121
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,522
No, no, it's not a problem.

122
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:48,719
I'll be over by 6:00. Okay.

123
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:51,663
5:00 p.m. Dr. House checks out.

124
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:55,098
It's 4:45.
I was rounding up.

125
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:58,034
Carol Moffatt.
Please see Dr. House in Exam One.

126
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:01,198
- Whoa, whoa, not so fast, Cathy.
- It's Carol.

127
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:04,368
Uh--
Uh, trouble with the leg?

128
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:08,546
- When's the wedding?
- This Saturday.

129
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:13,074
Ooh. Not much time
to fit into that pretty dress.
And no time for practical shoe shopping.

130
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:16,588
- You're running two miles a day
further than you should be.
- It hurts right here--

131
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:19,784
New shoes, less miles,
and ix-nay on the afternoon Cokes.
You're gonna look beautiful.

132
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:22,726
- What's wrong with you?
- I can't get my contact lenses out.

133
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:25,320
Out of what?
They're not in your eyes.

134
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,561
- But they're red.
- That's because you're trying
to remove your corneas.

135
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:31,398
What's wrong with you?
Uh, lately, my wife has noticed that--

136
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:34,803
Yeah, yeah. Symptoms.
We're working on a personal best here.

137
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:38,935
U-Uh, numbness in my feet
and hands, uh, constipation--

138
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:42,208
And?
Maybe he doesn't feel comfortable
talking about his private matters.

139
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:44,943
Well, neither would I if I was having
trouble controlling my pee-pee.

140
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:47,952
You're a dentist.
Nitrous oxide poisoning.

141
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,547
Which means you're either
dipping into your own supply
or you got a bad valve in your office.

142
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:54,184
Laughing gas rehab's probably
more expensive than the plumber.

143
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,558
Meanwhile, get yourself some B-12.

144
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,620
Who's left?
I can't see.

145
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:04,997
No, I'm just screwin' with you.
It's a hangover.

146
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:08,632
My English lit prof told me
he'd fail me next time
if I didn't show up with a doctor's note.

147
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:13,702
Well, make friends with the dentist.
He can give you a note, and maybe
a little nitrous to take the edge off.

148
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,583
Dr. House.

149
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:20,585
He tested negative for steroids.

150
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,587
Elevated beta-2 proteins though.

151
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:25,488
Could be cancerous--
amyloidosis or lymphoma.

152
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:27,458
Or steroids.
You guys got any money on you?

153
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:29,460
He tested negative for steroids.

154
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,689
I have a couple 20s on me.
Fifty of'em?

155
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:36,895
Foreman?
The fat-pad biopsy and abdominal C.T. scan
were negative for the cancers, but--

156
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,437
That just leaves us
with steroids.

157
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:41,496
He tested negative for steroids.

158
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:44,134
Less money is made by biochemists
working on a cure for cancer...

159
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:48,306
than by their colleagues struggling valiantly
to find ways to hide steroid use.

160
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,873
But there is one thing
they can't hide.

161
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:00,552
Hi. I'm Dr. House.

162
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:03,925
And this is the coolest day of my life.

163
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,035
See?
Steroid use shrinks the testicles.

164
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:16,241
I'm clean, man.
No steroids, no nothin'.

165
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:19,903
Your lips say no,
your prunes say yes.

166
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:22,846
Hypogonadism.
Isn't that a great word?

167
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:27,011
Thanks. We don't get
to say it nearly enough.
Start him on Lupron right away.

168
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:33,354
These freaks are willing
to defile themselves
for mass entertainment.

169
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:36,327
For money.
I feel sorry for them.

170
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:38,955
He drops a clean urine,
denies using steroids.

171
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:42,194
And you're giving him a drug
for what, steroid abuse?

172
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:45,533
No, no, it's not.
It's got calcium in it.

173
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:47,970
It's very good for the bones.

174
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,201
Basically, at a molecular level,
it's just milk.

175
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:54,970
Dr. Whitman to Anesthesiology.
Dr. Whitman, Anesthesiology.

176
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,880
How long do you figure
before I get a call from Cuddy?

177
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,817
- You put him on Lupron?
- Uh-huh.

178
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,150
- And you told them it was like milk.
- Yes.

179
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:06,282
Is there any way
in which that is not a lie?

180
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:09,517
It's creamy.

181
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:11,756
- But I had three reasons.
- Good ones?

182
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:15,164
Well, we'll see in a minute.
I'm just making them up now.

183
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,829
- He lied to me first.
- Your mother did teach you
two wrongs don't make a right.

184
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:22,931
If he lies to me about not taking steroids,
and I lie to him about not treating steroids,
he's cured.

185
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:24,805
Adds up for me.
Second reason.

186
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:27,141
If I told him the truth,
he wouldn't have taken the stuff.

187
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:30,182
And if he told you the truth,
what would the stuff do to him?

188
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,615
- Severe respiratory problems.
- Third reason?

189
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:35,313
I wanted to eliminate
the placebo effect.

190
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:37,480
Excellent.

191
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:40,354
You and your lawyer
can write a paper.

192
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,657
Which brings me to my fourth reason.
I thought you said
there were only three.

193
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:46,027
- I thought you'd buy one of'em.
- Seriously?

194
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,656
He's not gonna sue.

195
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:49,701
Because his lawyer is a nice guy...

196
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:54,035
who'll realize it's unfair to blame us
for ruining this kid's $100 million career.

197
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,040
Good guess, but no.

198
00:12:56,108 --> 00:13:00,101
If the Lupron causes respiratory problems,
it means he's not on steroids.

199
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:03,478
Which means there's
something else wrong with him.

200
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:06,211
And the choices
for that something else...

201
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,686
are almost universally very bad.

202
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:33,768
Osteopenia, messing his bones up.

203
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:38,374
Hypogonadism,
impaired liver function,
kidney function.

204
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:42,045
And we have managed to find
the only professional athlete in the galaxy...

205
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:44,180
who is not on steroids.

206
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:46,190
And it's not cancer.

207
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:48,192
So what's killing him?

208
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,286
Who shares my suspicions
that the Yankees were somehow involved?

209
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:55,265
Shrunken testicles indicate his body's
not putting out enough testosterone.

210
00:13:55,334 --> 00:14:00,067
Throw out the lungs.
That was the Lupron-- my fault.
Don't worry. I'll send him a nice note.

211
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,401
What about something environmental?

212
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:03,941
Arsenic, mercury.
The symptoms could indicate--

213
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,671
Pretty small environment.
Wife's fine, no one else is sick.

214
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:09,339
If you throw out the kidneys,
everything else adds up.

215
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,906
The testicles, the bones,
the impaired liver function...

216
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:14,680
could all be caused
by a breakdown
of his adrenal glands.

217
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:16,914
Addison's disease. I like it.

218
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,923
Mainly, ofcourse,
because the treatment is--

219
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:22,188
- Steroids.
- Enough irony for all of us.

220
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:23,853
Treatment would cause him
to retain fluid.

221
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:28,059
- With the kidneys almost
shut down already, he'll die.
- So we'll get him a new kidney.

222
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:31,330
Your theory is that Addison's
is causing all the symptoms...

223
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:33,394
except for the kidney problems.

224
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:37,806
- What's causing the kidney problems?
- Cameron, if you had to make
an ironic guess right about now--

225
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,311
He tested negative for steroids.

226
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,870
Agreed.
He's not on steroids now.

227
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:46,611
But if he was on them
at any time in the last five years,
it could have caused the kidney damage.

228
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:52,783
You see, kidneys don't wear watches.

229
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:57,318
Sure, gall bladders do, but it doesn't matter,
'cause kidneys can't tell time.

230
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:01,591
Steroid damage could take years.

231
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,897
No steroids. How many times
does he have to tell you?

232
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:05,834
I don't know.

233
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,840
How many times did he lie about cocaine
before coming clean with the league?

234
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,809
- That's completely different.
- Oh, that's right, I remember.

235
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:16,837
You never did come clean.
The league was out to get you.
They faked the blood tests.

236
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,850
You had to get yourself
a lawyer and everything.

237
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,547
If Hank says he never used steroids,
that's the truth.

238
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:28,287
That's too bad,
because our theory is that
the kidney damage is caused by "A",

239
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,294
and everything else
is caused by "B".

240
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:33,331
The beauty of this theory is
that we can treat "A" and "B".

241
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:36,857
But if you add the kidney symptoms
back into the mix,

242
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,803
then we are looking
at another letter altogether,

243
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,806
one that is apparently
not in the alphabet.

244
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:46,470
We can't fix the bones,
no more baseball, no more breathing,

245
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:48,479
no more brain function.

246
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:52,116
Get another explanation.

247
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:55,676
Okay. Yeah, I think I got one
in my other pants.

248
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:58,154
Hold on.

249
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,394
Five years ago. Bangor, Maine.

250
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:07,564
My pitching coach had me on something.
I never knew what it was.

251
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,366
And you never tried too hard
to find out either.

252
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:16,302
I gained twelve pounds of muscle
in, like, four weeks.

253
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,206
I'm sorry, baby.

254
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,904
Huh?

255
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,476
How ya doin', Doc?
Good. Very good, yeah.

256
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:35,354
You want me to put Hank Wiggen
on the transplant list.

257
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:38,590
He needs a new kidney. I was thinking
the kidney people might have some.

258
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:43,567
They like to save them for people who have--
How do I put this? Kidney problems.

259
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:46,502
He's a professional ball player.
Brings joy to millions.

260
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:49,735
Do you really want to be known as
the hospital that sent him home to die?

261
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:53,175
That's a great idea.
We could be the hospital
that killed two people--

262
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:56,737
the guy who deserved the kidney,
and the ball player we bumped up the list...

263
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:58,749
when we weren't even sure
what was wrong with him.

264
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:00,546
Everything else
is related to the Addison's.

265
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:02,849
The test for Addison's
was inconclusive.

266
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:05,719
The test for Addison's
is always inconclusive.

267
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,385
Why do we do it at all?
We should just ask you.

268
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,434
You're not putting him on the list.

269
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:19,130
Your powers of deduction
are breathtaking.

270
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:23,038
- You take a perverse pleasure
in turning me down.
- What I live for.

271
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:29,980
Once in a while, though, try to ruin my day--
ask me something I can say "Yes" to.

272
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:50,634
Oh, I'm sorry, Doctor.
I didn't know you were busy.
Want me to come back?

273
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:53,933
- Is he on the list?
- No.

274
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:57,305
- Then I'm giving him one of mine.
- Okay.

275
00:17:57,376 --> 00:18:00,675
You're not gonna tell me it's a bad idea?
Why give a kidney to someone
who might not be able to use it?

276
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,408
Not my area.

277
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,473
That is, however, my chair.

278
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:08,619
When do we do it?

279
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:10,951
Very noble gesture.

280
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:14,789
My favorite kind.
Dramatic, yet completely empty.

281
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,987
The chances of nonidentical twins
being a match--

282
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:18,996
You live alone?
You writing a book?

283
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:22,124
I made it a question
just 'cause it's more polite.

284
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:24,533
You got a big "keep out" sign
stapled on your forehead.

285
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,197
That explains it.
I told 'em to put it on my door.

286
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:32,539
Even if real human contact is something
you don't have or even want or need,

287
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,841
you should at least be able
to see it in other people.

288
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:36,380
Yeah. Right.

289
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:39,781
True love-- that's just how
we match organs these days.

290
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:43,515
There's a couple in France--
high school sweethearts--
they're trading brains.

291
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:47,452
We're a match. Run your tests.

292
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,408
Hey. The lab call?
Is she a match?

293
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,410
Haven't heard yet.

294
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:09,914
You got a text message, though.
"Friday night". Very cryptic.

295
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,883
Gee, thanks for checking.
Can you cover for me?

296
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:15,283
Oncology seminar.
Right.

297
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:18,016
Friday night the same thing
as the car trouble?

298
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,921
I had car trouble.

299
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,790
House says you were lying.
I believe him.

300
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:26,558
What's that?
You got a little wet smudge
at the end of your nose.

301
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:29,260
Hey, I like the guy.
He says what he wants,
does what he wants.

302
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,928
He won't talk to anyone
unless he can jerk them around.

303
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,768
Or needs a thousand bucks.
What is with that?

304
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,933
I scored.

305
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:41,004
It's a brave new world, Doc,

306
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:43,309
and we are the cutting edge.

307
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:49,447
You are looking
at two all-access passes...

308
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,250
to paradise itself.

309
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:56,358
How much?
True cost?
No man can say.

310
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:58,521
Could that man's accountant say?

311
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:00,861
One thousand dollars.
Whew.

312
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:04,960
Friday night.
The biggest official monster truck jam
in the history of New Jersey.

313
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:09,397
Okay, please tell me
you didn't just say Friday night.

314
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:12,443
Whatever you've got, you cancel.

315
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:15,412
I can't do it.
They only give these tickets
to owners.

316
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,916
Anytime we wanna be
in the middle of the track,
we're in the middle of the track.

317
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:22,784
These tickets are so good,
we have to sign a release.

318
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:25,414
I mean it.
We do this, we could die.

319
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,982
I've got the oncology thing.
I-- I--

320
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:32,929
The rectal cancer lecture--
they booked me a year ago.
I-I-I-I-I can't get out.

321
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:34,989
There's no way out.

322
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:39,401
Fine.
I'll ask one of my other friends.

323
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:41,564
Huh.

324
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:45,333
What? You're saying
I've only got one friend?

325
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:49,437
Uh... and wh-who--

326
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:53,250
Kevin in Bookkeeping.

327
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:56,116
Okay, well, first of all,
his name's Carl.

328
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,247
I call him Kevin.

329
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:01,019
It's his secret friendship club name.

330
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:04,928
It's hookers.
Oh, my God!

331
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:08,956
Multiple hookers. But House is House.
He's gotta have it his way.
Four or five women.

332
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:12,299
This isn't even funny.
What?
You don't think he has sex?

333
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:15,863
- No, ofcourse he--
- He doesn't have sex, he makes love.

334
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,875
I didn't say that.

335
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,309
It's the lab.

336
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:24,110
Dr. Foreman.

337
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:28,152
Respiratory Therapy, call 4702.

338
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,620
Respiratory Therapy,
pick up 4702.

339
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:35,626
If you have the results,
I'd like you to talk to both of us.
If you don't, I'm late for a meeting.

340
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:39,152
Believe me. I'd much rather
be with your better half.

341
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:43,065
And by better half, I mean the one who
struck out Sammy Sosa on three pitches...

342
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,501
and talks a lot less.

343
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:49,506
But I thought I would
talk to you first and alone.

344
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:52,737
I got your results back from the lab.

345
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,006
You do match.

346
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,241
I-- I do?

347
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,051
You're also pregnant.

348
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:13,829
You can't be a donor.

349
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:18,994
Not in your current condition.

350
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:33,145
Um... excuse me.

351
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:35,652
I have to go talk to my husband.

352
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:59,538
Heart looks good.
We can schedule the transplant.

353
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:01,374
No transplant.

354
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:03,812
Lola's not gonna have an abortion.

355
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:07,477
Actually, your wife just told me
that she was making an appointment.

356
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,747
I don't care what she said.

357
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:12,483
I think you two
need to discuss this further.

358
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:15,583
We've been trying to get pregnant
almost since we met.

359
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,720
Well, it's your wife's decision
whether or not--

360
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:21,823
She wants to trade a child
for a kidney. That's murder.

361
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,891
I'm not gonna let her do that.

362
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,840
Foreman says we've got a problem
about the transplant.

363
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:34,777
If she terminates the pregnancy,
he's not gonna let himself die on principle.

364
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:37,781
Would you give up a baby
for someone you love?

365
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:42,447
Please tell me I don't have to decide.

366
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:45,581
It depends.
How long would they live?

367
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:48,922
This is a pragmatic question
for you?

368
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:50,928
Fifty years, no problem.

369
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:53,430
Six months, I say let him die.

370
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:58,765
I've actually given this a lot of thought.
My personal tipping point is
seven years, eight months and 14 days.

371
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:00,429
I couldn't do it.

372
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:02,439
You found religion?

373
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:06,034
- Do you have to be religious
to believe a fetus is a life?
- There seems to be a correlation.

374
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:15,379
I'm, uh--

375
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:19,515
Do you like monster trucks?

376
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:23,987
- I don't know what they are.
- Right.

377
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:29,162
I got two tickets.
Friday night.

378
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:34,036
- You asking me to go with you?
- Sure. Sounds good.

379
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:36,835
Like a date?

380
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:38,899
Exactly.

381
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,968
Except for the-- the date part.

382
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:45,011
Forget it.

383
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:49,816
Uh, no, I-- I was gonna go
to the oncology dinner.

384
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:53,255
Ofcourse. You have to
hear Wilson's lecture.

385
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:56,317
No. I just found out he canceled,
like, two weeks ago.

386
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:06,268
So... what do I wear?

387
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,935
Still with us, Hank?
Yeah. I'm here.

388
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,443
My chest feels funny.

389
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:16,242
Tachycardia.
Your heart's beating too fast.

390
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:18,874
We're sorting it out.
But you stay with us, all right?

391
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:22,185
- Keep talking to us, Hank!
- Where's Lola?

392
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:25,781
Ten units of insulin sub-Q,
an I.V. push D-50.

393
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,291
- Why's his potassium up?
- Damned if I know.

394
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,420
Kayexalate too. We gotta suck
that potassium out of him.
We gotta get his heart rate down.

395
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:33,589
- We need a crash cart!
- You got it.

396
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:38,625
- It's definitely not Addison's.
- It's not steroids either.

397
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:42,036
Set.
Help in here, please!

398
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:46,669
His heart rate is 130 and rising
like a Randy Johnson line drives.

399
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:50,780
"A" for effort.
There's no point
in doing the transplant.

400
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:55,286
Even if he was stable enough,
it's obvious that we have no idea
what's wrong with him.

401
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:59,050
First it's too high.
Now it's too low?

402
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:03,825
His heart's not responding
to the atropine.

403
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:06,955
Heart rate's down to 40.
I thought it was up.

404
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:09,466
Now it's down.
Last time he went out at 35.

405
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:12,332
- What's wrong?
- I have no idea.

406
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:17,504
Hit him with the atropine
before he gets to 35 again.

407
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:20,970
We've already given him
three milliliters.

408
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:23,139
Apparently that's not enough.

409
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:26,083
We can't stabilize his heart rate.

410
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:28,085
What did you do to him?
Kayexalate.

411
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:31,145
His pulse was through the roof.
So was his potassium.

412
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:34,623
- It wouldn't do this.
- Something did.

413
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:41,426
Call me when he's stable.
Or dead.

414
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:53,506
I remember the first time.

415
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:57,543
You weren't even supposed
to be pitching that day.

416
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:00,050
I'd flown all the way to Tokyo
to watch this kid,

417
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:04,179
and he gets tossed
for arguing a call in the first inning.

418
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:09,985
Ah, your pitches-- perfect.

419
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:13,897
Ball seemed to go faster
than your arm.

420
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:18,993
It was like the rules didn't apply,
like physics couldn't slow you down.

421
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:22,268
Hot damn, it was beautiful.

422
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,471
Hey, Warner.

423
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,911
Hey, kid. How ya feelin'?

424
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:34,543
I hurt.

425
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:37,747
My arm, my head, everywhere.

426
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,686
They must've dialed down
the morphine.

427
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,752
That's just wrong, man.
You're in pain.

428
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:49,198
Hey, I got somethin' for ya.

429
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:53,362
No.

430
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:56,635
A doc in St. Louis
gave 'em to me for migraine.

431
00:27:56,708 --> 00:28:00,576
I'm an addict. I can't take that.
Even Lola was okay with the morphine.

432
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:03,273
This stuff's just a little stronger.

433
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,339
Come on.

434
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:13,357
I'll just try one, Warner.

435
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:18,193
Dr. Mulvaney,
please call extension 6134.

436
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:21,391
Dr. Mulvaney,
please call extension 6134.

437
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:23,798
Three more symptoms.

438
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:26,564
Heart rate up. Heart rate down.

439
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:29,607
Now he's hallucinating.
You gotta promise not to tell Lola.

440
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:33,543
Okay, coach?
He's not just dreaming?

441
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:36,978
No R.E.M.
He's actually awake.

442
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:39,573
Drugs?
Not psychedelics.

443
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:42,176
Not with the heart symptoms.

444
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:46,656
Well, hallucinations
would point to digitalis.
It would also mess up his heart.

445
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,989
But he's not on it.

446
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,688
And why would he take it?

447
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,762
Yeah.

448
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:56,926
Pithy analysis.

449
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:59,936
I can see why they asked you
to speak at the cancer dinner.

450
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:02,199
I'm sorry I'm gonna miss it.

451
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:04,468
I'm sorry
about the monster trucks.

452
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:07,636
No, I think it's great.
You're giving back.

453
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:12,513
Only thing is...

454
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,577
uh, digitalis,

455
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:20,887
it would only explain
the later symptoms,

456
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:22,950
not the original ones.

457
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:35,570
Sure, you know,
it's got a lot of movement.

458
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,574
Problem is,
everybody sees the movement.

459
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:41,043
You're throwin' your curveball
like you're-- you're throwin' a curveball.

460
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:44,707
Deception.
That's the--

461
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,717
Same motion.

462
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,720
Less movement,
but it won't come back at you.

463
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,780
All right, outfielders move in!
Right there!

464
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,523
How'd you get in here?

465
00:29:57,595 --> 00:30:01,190
Spoke Spanish.
Told them I was the new shortstop
from the Dominican.

466
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:03,962
How's Hank doin'?
Lousy.

467
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:11,002
Around your fingernails,
that swelling, it's called clubbing.

468
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:14,067
Hippocrates noticed that a lot
of his friends who also had that...

469
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,807
tended to frequently
grab their chests and die.

470
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:19,975
Yeah, I got a heart condition.
What's wrong with Hank?

471
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:22,315
What do you take for it?
Digitalis.

472
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:24,378
Got 'em with you?

473
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:28,692
Huh.
Well, that's weird.

474
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,856
I just filled this prescription
a couple days ago.
There's another bottle here.

475
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:34,990
Don't bother.

476
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:37,899
Hank Wiggen stole your pills.

477
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:39,834
He tried to kill himself.

478
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:58,478
So what happened?

479
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:02,859
He left the bottle open
while he went to get some water?

480
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:04,861
Next time,
just take the whole bottle.

481
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,594
Hey, man, you got no right.

482
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:11,499
See, people remember
how many they've got.

483
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:15,096
Date's right on the label,
number of pills--
regular person can do the math.

484
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:19,405
But a junkie doesn't have to,
because how many pills he's got left,
that's all he's thinking about.

485
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:22,412
Big insurance policy?

486
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:28,117
- This isn't about the money.
- Not for you, no.

487
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:32,418
Most reputable stores won't
cash your checks after you're dead.

488
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:36,221
But for Lola, well, girls like that,
they're all about the money.

489
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:38,421
Don't you say that.

490
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:41,260
She already saved my life.

491
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:44,733
I was dead in Japan. She brought me back.
Everything since then, that's gravy.

492
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:46,599
That's more than I deserve.

493
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:48,605
You owe her?
Everything.

494
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:50,732
Ah. So the attempted suicide,

495
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:54,835
the scaring her to death--
what is that? That's gratitude?

496
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,778
Love?

497
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:58,873
Yeah, I get that.

498
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:05,285
Well, take out
what you did to yourself yesterday--
we're back to the kidneys and the bones.

499
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:08,958
I'm scheduling the transplant.

500
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:17,193
Never visit a patient.

501
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,860
I want that baby!

502
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,838
Even if I'm gone,
that's a piece of me and Lola...

503
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:24,704
breathing, walking around town,

504
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,767
goin' to baseball games.

505
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:32,476
If there's any more transplant talk
from you, Lola, or anybody else,

506
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:35,975
I won't screw it up this time.

507
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:38,045
I'll take myself out for good.

508
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:46,620
I'll start treating the Addison's,
which will most likely destroy
what's left of your kidneys.

509
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:49,326
Fine.
Start the treatment.

510
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,965
Hey.

511
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:02,646
What--
Hank Wiggen peed on me.

512
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:05,512
What do you think these pants
are worth on eBay?

513
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:08,984
I've got some big boy diapers in my office.
The rep hands 'em out like candy.

514
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:12,386
Is it that bad?
No, not if you like
the smell of urine.

515
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:16,450
Ofcourse, why should I
trust someone who lies
about what he's doing Friday night?

516
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:20,997
Question is, what are you
really doing Friday night?

517
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:25,126
Or more to the point,
what could possibly be better
than monster trucks?

518
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:27,194
Or are we breaking up?

519
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:47,558
Stacy's coming into town
this weekend.

520
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:49,559
We're having dinner.

521
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:51,618
Just catching up.

522
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,056
I definitely had pants here.

523
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:57,931
Wait a second.
Is that Stacy the stripper?

524
00:33:58,002 --> 00:33:59,936
I heard she's playing Atlantic City.

525
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:04,304
No, Stacy the constitutional lawyer.

526
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:07,436
You thought
I couldn't handle this news.

527
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,373
You talk to her a lot?

528
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:17,683
No, it's been a long time.

529
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:24,753
- If you don't want me to see her--
- What is this, eighth grade? I'm fine.

530
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:26,763
It's fine if you're upset.

531
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:28,731
No, it's--

532
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:31,968
I have no right to be upset.

533
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:35,165
You two were friends.

534
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:40,102
You should see her.

535
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:42,169
Say hi for me.

536
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,339
So, you're okay?

537
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:48,408
I'm not the cancer doctor
who's lying about the cancer dinner.

538
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:53,982
I'm not the one betraying
all those poor little bald-headed dying kids.

539
00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:00,457
I'm gonna go get some pants.
I stink.

540
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:10,436
You're treating him for Addison's
and you don't think it's gonna work?

541
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:14,239
He tried to kill himself.
I know.

542
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:18,806
He's confused. We can have another baby.
I can make him understand that.

543
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:21,283
I'm having an abortion.
We do the transplant--
No.

544
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:23,377
I can make decisions
about my body.

545
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:27,788
And he can make decisions about his.
He doesn't want your kidney.

546
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:32,490
So he'll die?

547
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:36,223
Probably.

548
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:57,877
If you keep that appointment,
he'll also probably die.

549
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,856
Keep the baby.

550
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,833
Are you just being polite?

551
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:24,681
My pants are--

552
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:27,684
Oh, they're all wet.

553
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:33,986
You can't smell that?

554
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,357
You think she'll abort anyway,
try to force his hand?

555
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:42,422
No, she's not gonna
risk losing him.

556
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:45,469
That's funny?

557
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:51,634
No, the monster trucks.
House asking you, that's-- that's funny.

558
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:55,145
I was the first person he ran into.
He just asked me.

559
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,942
Yeah, like a date.

560
00:36:57,014 --> 00:37:00,211
Exactly.
Except for the date part.

561
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:10,559
If the patient decides to go the dialysis route,
we've got some product you should check out.

562
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:13,791
Mmm.
Hey, Dr. Foreman.

563
00:37:13,864 --> 00:37:17,561
Courtesy of the generous Sharon
and the good folks
at Castine Pharmaceuticals.

564
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:19,762
I was just telling the guys about
the Bermuda conference in April.

565
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:22,965
Three days of sun and scuba,
and one hour of lecture.

566
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,235
Oh, God, do we have
to go to the lecture?

567
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:28,278
So, you're the new Arnie.

568
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:31,909
Dr. House.
It's good to see you.

569
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:35,316
Would you get me a coffee?
Black, no sugar.

570
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:45,355
Okay, so who is it?

571
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,454
Come on.
She's sleeping with one of you.

572
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:51,233
Oh, God, please tell me it's you.

573
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:53,327
She buys lunches.
She doesn't--

574
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:55,634
Don't worry. You're not gay.
You're adventurous.

575
00:37:56,841 --> 00:38:00,368
You think she's gonna prostitute herself?
The three of us are that important to her?

576
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,309
I'm afraid not, no.

577
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:05,543
The groupies sleep with the roadies
in order to get to Mick.

578
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:08,813
And you're Mick?
That was the metaphor
I was making, yes.

579
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:11,787
Why are you here?

580
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:14,882
Damn, it's you.

581
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:21,163
It's not Addison's.
New symptom. Inability to smell.

582
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:23,462
I was just in Hank's room.

583
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:26,970
He said it smelled like the men's room
at Veteran's Stadium. He was right.

584
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:29,336
We rejected environmental causes
because the wife was healthy.

585
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:32,399
Well, she's not. Last six months,
she can't smell a thing.

586
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:38,504
If you think of them as one single patient,
you add her symptoms to his--

587
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:41,073
Cadmium poisoning.

588
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:44,485
It explains everything. Even why they
had so much trouble getting pregnant.

589
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:47,046
How could they have gotten
exposed to that much cadmium?

590
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:50,025
Unless they were eating
steel and batteries for breakfast.

591
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:53,427
So, where else is cadmium?
Some foods,
polluted groundwater.

592
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:56,489
We should check their home.
I think I know
how it happened.

593
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,500
I'm gonna need
another urine sample.

594
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:02,732
What for?
Sure.

595
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:04,240
Whatever you want.

596
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:07,004
Why wouldn't you give it to me before,
but now it's no problem?

597
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:10,912
- I'm dyin', right?
- So you've got nothing to lose this time.

598
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:15,719
Begs the question,
what were you worried about last time?

599
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:20,755
The funny thing is,
when we tested you before,
we were just looking for steroids.

600
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:23,851
What should we look for now, Hank?

601
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:27,864
Hank, what's the story?

602
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:32,030
A little weed every now and then
when no one was looking?

603
00:39:36,273 --> 00:39:38,503
I don't believe this.

604
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:40,874
- We quit.
- You did.

605
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:43,675
If you'd kept going, you wouldn't
have just lost your sense of smell.

606
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:45,215
I quit the hard stuff.

607
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:51,147
- I just needed to relax.
- Based on the symptoms,
you're a lot more than a social user.

608
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:55,056
So you've been lying to me
all this time?
I'm sorry.

609
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:58,584
There must have been
cadmium in the soil
where the marijuana was grown.

610
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:03,929
Some people get bone loss,
kidney failure,
some people's testes shrink,

611
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:07,459
and some people
lose their sense of smell.

612
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:09,335
We'll start treatment
right away.

613
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:12,137
You should be fine by opening day.

614
00:40:12,209 --> 00:40:14,575
Baseball's in the summer, right?

615
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:16,806
It didn't hurt the baby, did it?
The cadmium?

616
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:20,783
- If you've been clean,
the baby should be fine.
- Okay.

617
00:40:23,053 --> 00:40:27,820
Please. I'll stop everything.
I'll-- I'll go to meetings every day.

618
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,328
Lola.

619
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:37,190
Twice a day.

620
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:40,399
How's the ballplayer doing?

621
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:43,167
Much better.
Too bad about his career.

622
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,571
What do you mean?

623
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:46,667
Major League Baseball's
collective bargaining agreement...

624
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:49,235
requires medical reports
on all treatment.

625
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:51,907
Given Hank's history,
he's not likely to get much leniency.

626
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:54,917
Why should they care
that he's being treated for Addison's?

627
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:57,852
You're not treating him
for Addison's.
My report says I am.

628
00:40:57,922 --> 00:40:59,947
You're lying on the report?

629
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:02,959
Well, everybody does stupid things.

630
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:05,461
It shouldn't cost them
everything they want in life.

631
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:09,988
No, it shouldn't,
but it usually does.

632
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:14,299
On the other hand,
if it means someone
can actually beat the Yankees--

633
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:20,800
So what about House?
Is there any way
we can get him down there?

634
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:26,846
You really wanna talk
about work?

635
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:30,945
No. Not at all.

636
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:54,443
That was amazing!

637
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:57,811
I'm telling you.
Grave Digger never disappoints.

638
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:05,545
You ever been married?

639
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:10,549
Well, now, let's not ruin
a lovely night out
by getting personal.

640
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:15,054
I lived with someone
for a while.

641
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:18,958
You gonna finish that?

642
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,568
I'll race you to the car.
