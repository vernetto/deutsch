1
00:00:01,468 --> 00:00:04,198
Radiologist, contact 5317.

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:07,706
Radiologist, contact 5317.

3
00:00:07,774 --> 00:00:10,038
Amber.
No.

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,977
Why not?
Amber's a stripper name.

5
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:16,345
Find me one stripper
named Amber Hartig.

6
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:18,350
Or not. Okay.

7
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:21,046
Non-stripper names.
Um, Desiree?

8
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:23,055
Bambi? Kandy Kane?

9
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:25,489
Max.

10
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:27,492
Maxine.

11
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,051
Max Hartig.
It's a cute name, isn't it?

12
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:33,395
If you're a professional boxer,
maybe.

13
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:35,764
Can you believe we made
this little creature?

14
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:40,238
I know. It's incredible.
It's the most amazing thing
we've ever done.

15
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:43,607
I almost ran the marathon
last year.

16
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:46,770
If we're lucky, you won't inherit
your daddy's sense of humor.

17
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:49,610
Hello. Say "hi" to Bear.

18
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:55,846
She hasn't even eaten anything.
Why is she spitting up?

19
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:58,857
Well, honey,
we can't bug them again.
Could you--

20
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:01,325
Okay, okay.

21
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:06,963
I'm sorry. It's our first kid.
We're both a little panicky,
I guess.

22
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:10,730
Well, you gotta ask
the pediatrician next time.
I just deliver 'em.

23
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:13,967
- Is she spitting up?
- Yeah. Second time in an hour.

24
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,032
Oh. If you lived underwater
for nine months,

25
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,601
you'd have a lot to spit up too.

26
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:25,908
Is something wrong?
A little lethargic.

27
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:29,785
- Well, we didn't think--
- She's hot.

28
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,824
Is she, uh--

29
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:34,917
The baby's seizing!
Get the crash cart!

30
00:01:34,994 --> 00:01:37,656
- What's -What's wrong?
- Need some help in here!

31
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,255
Oh, God. Is she all right?

32
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,324
- I. V. access?
- No. Ativan.

33
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:44,893
What's going on?

34
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:22,737
The M.R.I.'s back.

35
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,369
And?
It's what we expected.

36
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:28,278
The accident caused
serious damage.

37
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:31,940
It's amnesia.

38
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,449
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,584
I just can't believe it.

40
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:48,860
Enjoying our lounge, House?

41
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:52,098
Just came in
to get milk for my coffee,
which you're out of.

42
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,265
- Flat or sparkling?
- Sparkling.
- Splat.

43
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,936
So, the Hartigs?

44
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:02,277
Their baby gets a fever.
What, don't tell me--
the kid had a seizure.

45
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:06,148
Yep. The parents, ofcourse, start freaking,
and I have to deal with that for an hour.

46
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:09,017
Like it was your fault.
She was perfect
when I delivered her.

47
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:12,285
If you wanna blame someone,
blame the pediatrician.
So, how is the kid now?

48
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:16,624
Bowel obstruction.
She's under observation.
She'll be fine.

49
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,688
The pediatrician
will take all the credit.

50
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:30,066
Exhibit A: Baby Girl Hartig.

51
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:32,134
Term baby, 42 hours old.

52
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,306
Went into seizures six hours ago,
brought into the intensive care...

53
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:38,282
diagnosed with obstruction
of the small bowel.

54
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:40,911
I'm still amazed you're actually
in the same room with a patient.

55
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:42,978
People don't bug me
until they get teeth.

56
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,320
Exhibit B:
Baby Boy Hausen.

57
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,621
Another term baby, 48 hours old.

58
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:50,788
Brought into the NICU
three hours before the Hartig baby.

59
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:53,957
Fever of unknown origin,
101 degrees, trending upwards.

60
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:55,967
Wow, that is amazing.

61
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:58,970
You hung out in the OB/GYN lounge
all morning and heard about two sick babies.

62
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:02,269
- It's-- It's eerie.
- Don't touch that.

63
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:05,334
All right.
We have an infection
spreading in the hospital.

64
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:08,903
These kids have totally
unrelated illnesses.

65
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,507
They fell sick within four hours
of each other.

66
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:15,611
They had the same delivery rooms,
maternity rooms are neighboring,
so transmission's possible.

67
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:18,521
- They have the same symptoms.
- The Hartig girl has a bowel obstruction.

68
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,685
No matter how close their beds are,
I'm pretty sure kids can't share a blockage.

69
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,252
What does bowel obstruction
on a chart indicate?

70
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,060
Normally I'd say it indicates
a patient's bowel is obstructed,

71
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:29,624
but I'm pretty sure you have
some deeper truth to impart.

72
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:34,298
It means that some random doctor
of indeterminate skill thinks that
the patient's bowel is obstructed.

73
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:37,468
- Okay, you're upset because
they threw you out of their lounge.
- Look at the X-ray.

74
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:41,377
It's a normal gas pattern.
If you want, I can get you a key
to the oncology lounge.

75
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,438
Air in the colon.
We're getting TiVo.

76
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:45,848
If it's air,
no bowel obstruction.

77
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:48,910
Even if it is air,
it could have been there
before the obstruction.

78
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:51,980
No. Something's infected
both these infants.

79
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:56,918
And you're the only one
who put this together because--

80
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:59,328
Because I'm the only one
who looked at both kids.

81
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:02,061
I want them isolated.
I want the maternity ward shut down.

82
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,797
Because you're better
at reading an X-ray
than a radiologist.

83
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:09,103
Radiologists always overread
babies' X-rays, especially if they're
asked to rule out a pathology.

84
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:12,576
- He read into it what he wanted.
- Which is exactly what you're doing.

85
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,876
You're finding a cluster because you
think it's interesting to find a cluster.

86
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:19,247
Two plain old sick babies
would bore you.

87
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,083
See, this is why I don't
waste money on shrinks,

88
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,646
'cause you give me all these
really great insights for free.

89
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:28,353
Shrink. If you would
consider going to a shrink,
I would pay for it myself.

90
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:31,591
The hospital would hold
a bake sale, for God's sake.

91
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,064
We have an epidemic!

92
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:39,537
Two sick babies is very sad,
but it doesn't prove an epidemic.

93
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,779
How many do?

94
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:53,242
Get up.
We're going hunting.

95
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,378
For what?

96
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:57,616
Wabbits.

97
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,336
Hi. Bye.

98
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:13,895
He's screaming. He's fine.

99
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,311
Good-looking baby.

100
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:27,416
Oh, sorry. Wrong room.
We'll see you later.

101
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,682
Twelve rooms, right?
That's it?

102
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:33,248
Yep. We've definitely
checked the whole floor.

103
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:37,256
Good news.
No epidemic.

104
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,321
Tragic, huh?

105
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:44,600
Overflow rooms,
third floor.

106
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,264
This imaginary infection
has spread to the next floor?

107
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:51,940
We were just gonna call.
Did he get hot all of a sudden?

108
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,737
Yeah.

109
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,982
Yeah, I'll take care of that for you.

110
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:09,717
Almost there, honey.
Don't worry. We're almost there.

111
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:12,321
Excuse me! Hi.
Hi.

112
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:14,889
Intake sent you up here?
Yeah, my wife's contractions
are less than--

113
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:17,197
Okay, Intake messed up.
I am very, very sorry.

114
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,738
Nurse Alpert will arrange
for an ambulance...

115
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:23,242
to take you to Princeton General.

116
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:26,745
The maternity ward
is temporarily closed.
We have to leave?

117
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:29,748
Yes. I am very sorry.
Why are you doing this?

118
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:32,808
You will be there
very, very soon.

119
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:37,420
Happy now?
No.

120
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,323
But I am interested.

121
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:49,496
Three sick babies, and a fourth
showing early symptoms.

122
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:51,503
- How bad?
- Spiking fevers.

123
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:54,039
B.P.'s plummeting.
They're barely able to keep systolic up.

124
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:56,540
- At this rate, they could be dead in a day.
- Where did this come from?

125
00:07:56,609 --> 00:08:00,477
Two delivery rooms, four different
maternity rooms. No common personnel
and no common equipment.

126
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:03,310
- There's got to be something in common.
- Yeah.

127
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:06,545
That would be the difference
between an epidemic and a coincidence.

128
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:09,713
I'm putting a team together.
We're gonna start swabbing.

129
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:13,725
What's she gonna swab?
Every respirator, sink, vent, drain
in the entire hospital?

130
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:15,488
- That'll take months.
- Needle in a haystack.

131
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:18,394
It's worse than that,
We don't even know
it's a needle we're looking for.

132
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:23,367
- Then why'd you let her go do it?
- Because the hospital is her baby,
and her baby's sick.

133
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:26,701
If she doesn't solve this soon,
her head's gonna explode, and I
don't want to get any on me.

134
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:28,706
So let's figure out
what's in the haystack.

135
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:30,901
- Differential diagnosis, people.
- Parasite.

136
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:33,502
- It's spreading too quickly.
- Next?

137
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:37,913
- Virus?
- The kids are too sick, and the blood tests
showed no lymphocytosis.

138
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:40,475
And they're not responding
to acyclovir or ribavirin.

139
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:42,851
If it's some other virus,
we'll never find it in time anyway.

140
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:46,858
Which leads us
to bacterial infection.

141
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:51,090
It's not responding
to broad-spectrum antibiotics,
so we've got something resistant.

142
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:54,189
- The usual suspects?
- MRSA. It's always MRSA in hospitals.

143
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,758
Maybe contaminated food
or water source.

144
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:58,701
Pseudomonas.

145
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:00,864
V.R.E.?
"H" flu.

146
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,773
Okay. Those are the big ones.

147
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:07,643
Cultures will take 48 hours.
Might as well be postmortem.

148
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:11,877
We'll start them on vancomycin
for the MRSA and aztreonam
to cover the rest.

149
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:17,048
Let's get M.R.I.'s,
check for abscesses
or some occult infection.

150
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:21,253
I'll be in the clinic.
Grab me if you find something
important... or unimportant.

151
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:27,682
We did an M.R.I. on all the babies, and,
unfortunately, we didn't find anything,

152
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,719
so we're starting them
on the strongest antibiotics
that we've got,

153
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:35,130
and we're hoping that
that will take care of it.

154
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:37,465
But he's so tiny.

155
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:39,470
How sick is he?

156
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:42,632
His fever's up to 103.5,
and his blood pressure is 80 over 40.

157
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,142
How, um-- How bad is that?

158
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,104
Uh--

159
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:53,015
It-It's low. The heart needs
to circulate the blood.

160
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:57,215
If it's weak, the oxygen isn't getting
to the liver, the kidneys, the brain.

161
00:10:57,289 --> 00:11:00,725
Um, I have to ask you something.

162
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:02,488
Judy--
No, no, Kim. Let me.

163
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:07,893
Um, I had a cold last month,
and I told the doctors about it.

164
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:10,060
Honey, this has nothing
to do with you.

165
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:12,502
Kim's right.

166
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:15,165
Your son was born healthy.

167
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:17,505
He caught the infection
after his birth.

168
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:20,170
There's no reason to think
that he caught it from you.

169
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:24,580
But you don't know. I mean,
you don't know how he got sick.

170
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:33,489
Pretty standard question--
"How sick is my child?"
You couldn't answer.

171
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:37,290
I answered.
You rattled off numbers--
B.P., O2 sats.

172
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:41,697
It's not what they need to know.
What they need to know is the future.
You got a Magic 8 ball?

173
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:44,429
No, just eight years
of medical training.

174
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:51,303
Look, I realize it's tough
to break bad news to families.

175
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,470
Not as tough as hearing it.

176
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:57,778
And I guess being the poor guy dying
is the toughest of all?

177
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,341
No.

178
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:03,911
It's easier to die
than to watch someone die.

179
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:11,889
Well, we're checking the vents.
It could be airborne.

180
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:15,024
Somebody get the sinks, too,
and underneath them.

181
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:17,035
I'll get it.

182
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:20,095
How many med students
have you got swabbing the decks?

183
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:23,073
What else are they gonna do?
It's not like they're delivering babies.

184
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:25,702
You find anything yet?
Uh, yeah.

185
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:29,509
About half
the antibacterial gel dispensers
are empty or broken.

186
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:33,245
That's bad, yet diagnostically
completely insignificant.

187
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:38,256
Well, if the staff can't wash
their hands, it's no wonder
an infection has spread.

188
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:41,452
Hey! Tie clip!
Sorry?

189
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:46,123
We have an epidemic
in this hospital, and your tie
is becoming a petri dish.

190
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:49,656
Put on a tie clip
or take the damn thing off.

191
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:55,938
My joints have been feeling all loose,
and lately I've been feeling sick a lot.

192
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:57,942
Maybe I'm over-training.

193
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:01,673
I'm doing the marathon,
like, 10 miles a day, but I can't
seem to lose any weight.

194
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:04,443
Lift up your arms.

195
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,949
You have a parasite.

196
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:14,118
Like a tapeworm
or something?
Lie back and lift up your sweater.

197
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:17,185
You can put your arms down.

198
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:20,289
Can you do anything about it?
Only for about a month or so.

199
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:23,494
After that it becomes illegal to remove,
except in a couple states.

200
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:26,163
Illegal?
But don't worry.

201
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:29,139
Many women learn
to embrace this parasite.

202
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:33,372
They name it, dress it up in tiny clothes,
arrange playdates with other parasites.

203
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:36,812
- Playdates?
- It has your eyes.

204
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:41,219
But that's impossible.

205
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:44,620
Well, I assume you weren't
getting your period.

206
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,658
Maybe that should have
given you an inkling.

207
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:49,421
But I'm on this
birth control implant.
Yeah, I know.

208
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:54,296
I saw the scar on your arm.
And my doctor said I might not get
any periods at all if it was working.

209
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:57,665
Mm-hmm. Interestingly enough,
you also don't get any periods
if it isn't working,

210
00:13:57,736 --> 00:14:00,569
which is why you were supposed
to get regular pregnancy tests.

211
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,733
Oh!
I'm gonna send a nurse in here
to schedule your prenatal care.

212
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:07,108
You're due in about five months,
so start planning the shower.

213
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:10,381
Um, Doctor?

214
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:15,978
Please, me and my husband
wanted to have a kid soon,

215
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:18,489
but, oh, God,

216
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:22,857
like four months ago,
we had this really big fight.

217
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:27,228
He moved out.
I did something stupid.

218
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:31,065
One-night stand?
Ex-boyfriend.

219
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:34,401
Well, I'll schedule you
a paternity test too.

220
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:36,771
I can't let my husband know.

221
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:39,276
Does the old boyfriend look
like your husband?

222
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:42,075
Yeah.

223
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:44,445
Then just have the kid.
He'll never know.

224
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:47,485
The most successful marriages
are based on lies.

225
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,283
You're off to a great start.

226
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,588
Well, you look cheery.
What's going on?

227
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,458
The Hartig and Chen-Lupino babies,
their kidneys are shutting down.

228
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:00,089
And the urine tests show no casts.

229
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,968
Which means the antibiotics
are causing the kidney failure.

230
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:07,563
You're the nephrologist.
Which one did it?
We'll take 'em off that one.

231
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:13,903
- Don't tell me
both vancomycin and aztreonam.
- They both can cause this.

232
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:15,970
There's no way to know
which one it is. No test.

233
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:19,381
We can't take 'em off
the antibiotics though.
They'll die of the infection.

234
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:21,942
If we leave them
on both the antibiotics,
they'll die of kidney failure.

235
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:26,253
So, we take our best guess then.
Which drug's causing the kidney failure?

236
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:30,955
It's like I said,
it's always MRSA in hospitals.
Take them off aztreonam.

237
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:34,431
I still think it's the pseudomonas.
I vote to take them
off the vancomycin.

238
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,498
There's no point in guessing.

239
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:49,470
Take one kid off vancomycin,
the other off aztreonam.

240
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:54,010
- They have the same disease.
You want to give them different treatments?
- What the hell are you doing?

241
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:58,318
- Therapeutic trial,
to find the cause of the infection.
- That's wrong.

242
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:01,518
We have four sick kids at least.

243
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:05,188
- Who knows how many more
haven't started showing symptoms yet?
- We have a duty to these two.

244
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:08,700
If these two have different reactions,
we'll know how to save the rest.

245
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:13,204
So you're condemning
one of these kids to die
based on random chance?

246
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:22,203
I guess I am.

247
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:33,990
So you're going to flip a coin?

248
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:36,118
That's how you decide
which baby lives?

249
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:38,823
Can I borrow a quarter?

250
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:41,331
Do you want to get sued,
lose your license, House?

251
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,460
Well, generally I'd applaud that,
but my job is to protect this hospital,

252
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:47,664
so I strongly advise you to come up
with a medical rationale...

253
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,935
why baby "A" should get medicine "X"
and vice versa.

254
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:54,446
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on there, slick.
We didn't all go to law school.

255
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:59,007
Your advice is that I should use
medical reasons to make medical decisions?
Hmm, that's not gonna be as easy.

256
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:01,609
Any medical justification.
It doesn't need to be a good one.

257
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:06,351
Well, "Hartig" sounds Jewish,
so does aztreonam, so we'll take
the Hartig kid off vancomycin.

258
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:08,552
How's that?

259
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:11,494
- You can't experiment on babies.
- Doctors experiment all the time.

260
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:15,294
- On adults, with their consent.
- Fine. I'll get the parents' consent.

261
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:19,201
Their informed consent.
They have to know the other kid
is getting a different treatment.

262
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:23,139
Sorry. Can't do that. It would be
unethical for one patient to know
about another patient's treatment.

263
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:27,338
- They have a right to know.
- If they know, they won't consent.
That defeats the whole purpose.

264
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:29,643
That's their right.

265
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,707
Two more babies
have just become symptomatic.

266
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:34,776
I defer to your legal wisdom.

267
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:39,552
Which takes precedence--
six dying babies
or a missing consent form?

268
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,219
You can't do it.

269
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,164
Do what you think is best.

270
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:19,028
Your daughter's kidneys
are shutting down.

271
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,430
Your son's kidneys are failing.

272
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,525
So we're going to
take her off the aztreonam.

273
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,433
We're taking him
off vancomycin.

274
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:28,598
Uh, but what--
what made her sick
in the first place?

275
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:32,542
- What do you think is causing it?
- It seems to be a germ called pseudomonas.

276
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:36,479
We think it's MRSA--
Methicillin-resistant staph aureus.

277
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:39,574
It's a very resistant form
of a very common bacteria.

278
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:42,119
We're hoping the aztreonam
will clear it up.

279
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:46,123
Vancomycin is the best treatment for MRSA,
so we're gonna keep giving it to her.

280
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:48,955
Is it gonna cure her?

281
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:56,329
Your child is very sick.
You need to know that.

282
00:18:56,401 --> 00:19:00,064
This is a Hail Mary pass.
It might cure her. It might not.

283
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:07,938
So-So, that'll cure him?

284
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:12,783
We'll know in 24 hours
if it's working.

285
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,961
What did you tell them?
I told them the truth.

286
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:35,302
They seemed relieved.
Did you tell them how sick their son is?

287
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:38,775
I explained what was going on.
Allison, their baby's dying.

288
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,836
If the parents weren't in tears
by the time you left,
you didn't tell them the truth.

289
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:44,576
That's not how I see it.
Do you want them blindsided?

290
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,983
Want them coming up and saying,
"My God, my baby died.
Why didn't you warn me?"

291
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:50,715
So now it's about worrying
about them yelling at us?
No.

292
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:53,553
It's about getting them prepared
for the likely death of their child.

293
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:57,083
If their son dies tomorrow,
you think they'll give a damn
what I said to them today?

294
00:19:57,162 --> 00:20:01,462
It's not gonna matter.
They're not gonna care. Nothing's
gonna be the same ever again.

295
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:04,832
Just give those poor women
a few hours of hope.

296
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:12,576
Dr. House!
Oh, no.

297
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:15,442
Dr. House,
this is my husband, Charlie.

298
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,482
Who told you
where my office was?

299
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,040
Jill, come on.
He obviously doesn't
want us bothering him.

300
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:22,450
Ooh, I was trying to hide it.

301
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:27,356
Look, Doctor,
this is about the mono
that you said you thought I had.

302
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:29,360
The mono?
Yes.

303
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:31,521
You know,
shouldn't Charlie be tested?

304
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:35,897
You know, the test.
The blood test.

305
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:38,596
Right.

306
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:42,037
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I-- I sometimes forget patients.

307
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:45,201
I thought you were this idiot
who doesn't know how to use
birth control.

308
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:49,714
I can't have mono.
I don't even feel sick
or anything.

309
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,141
That's very often the first sign.

310
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:57,086
Call my office in the morning,
and I'll schedule you for blood tests.

311
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:59,089
Thank you.

312
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:01,523
I'm not even tired.
Oh.

313
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:13,270
Find anything yet?

314
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:18,037
Oh, just some baby formula
being stored under a sink
with a dripping faucet.

315
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,874
Tap water contamination.
You thinking pseudomonas infection?

316
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,608
I was.
I wasted a couple of hours
chasing it down.

317
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:27,118
But, ofcourse, the formula hasn't
been anywhere near the babies.

318
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:29,176
Huh.
Whatever idiot stored them there--

319
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:32,121
All right, we'll figure it out.
Just-Just calm down.

320
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,387
I am calm.
Let me know
when you're gonna need it.

321
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,623
Oh, come--
I warned you.

322
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:40,756
I did that calmly.

323
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,531
Hey.
Hi.

324
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,668
She any better?

325
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:54,576
Uh, her fever has been stable
the last hour.

326
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:59,010
We're not gonna make it,
are we?

327
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:01,177
Sorry?

328
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:03,244
Me and Ethan.

329
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:07,817
Our next-door neighbor,

330
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:09,884
her little boy died
in a car crash,

331
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:13,863
and she and her husband split up,
like, four months after the funeral.

332
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:18,426
It's just, uh,
what always happens, right?

333
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:25,666
Uh, what happens to patients
after they leave the hospital,
I don't know,

334
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:28,975
but try not to get ahead
of yourself.

335
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:35,843
Dr. Chase, activity on the monitor.

336
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:37,821
How long?
I don't know.
It just started.

337
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:40,016
Pulse? Fluid, wide open.

338
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:41,992
Do we have an arterial line?
Not yet.

339
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,722
Let's get a B.P.

340
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:48,165
You can't come in here.
Is my baby dying?

341
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:50,531
- Mrs. Hartig--
- Is she dying?
- Ma'am, you'll have to leave.

342
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:52,593
It's not your baby.

343
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:58,372
Ventilate.

344
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:00,968
B.P. 60 over 20.

345
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,844
Heart rate's 180.
Start the levophed.

346
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:06,315
Still dropping.

347
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,319
50 over 10.

348
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,319
I can't hold B.P.,
even with three pressors.

349
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:17,694
I'm losing pulse.

350
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:19,731
V-fib.

351
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:22,392
Shut the blinds.

352
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,742
Charging.
Set.

353
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:36,542
Clear.

354
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:38,708
Still V-fib.

355
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:41,412
Charging. Clear.

356
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:45,885
Charging. Clear.

357
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:52,392
Still V-fib.

358
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:55,399
Charging. Clear.

359
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,905
- Charging.
- Chase.

360
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:07,373
Time of death-- 6:57 p.m.

361
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:32,629
The aztreonam doesn't work.

362
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:35,901
Double-cover all the other babies
with vancomycin.

363
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,908
I'll do it.

364
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:41,309
Cameron, tell the parents.

365
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:43,813
Tell them their child
probably saved five lives.

366
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:47,751
- But Chase should--
- Chase is busy.

367
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,980
You're the attending.

368
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,988
Make sure she does her job.

369
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:59,514
I asked you to make sure
she does her job, not do it for her.

370
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:02,719
She froze up.
She felt sorry for the parents,
so she shut up.

371
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:06,093
You felt sorry for her,
so you opened your mouth.
She has a problem.

372
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:09,156
She needs to deal with it.
If you hadn't bailed her out,
she would have done it.

373
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,566
Great. Then she wouldn't
have slept for two weeks.

374
00:26:11,636 --> 00:26:14,332
Maybe she should be thinking
about a different specialty.

375
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,340
Lab work? Research?

376
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:21,402
- Yeah, what is it?
- The Hartig baby--
she's getting sicker too.

377
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:23,538
The vancomycin
isn't working either.

378
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,985
Vancomycin doesn't kill it.
Aztreonam doesn't kill it.

379
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:35,822
What the hell is this?

380
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:39,762
It's a superbug.
It could be V.R.S.A.

381
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:42,356
There's only been two reported cases
ever in the United States.

382
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:45,597
One of the kids,
the Hausen baby, had a skin rash.

383
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:49,902
It could be scalded-skin syndrome,
which would be a sign of V.R.S.A.
Then these kids are dead.

384
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:52,034
This is our fault.

385
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:55,079
Doctors overprescribing antibiotics.

386
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:57,706
Got a cold?
Take some penicillin.

387
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:01,047
Sniffles? No problem.
Have some azithromycin.

388
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:04,088
Is that not working anymore?
Well, got your levaquin.

389
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:06,282
Antibacterial soaps
in every bathroom.

390
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:09,759
They'll be adding vancomycin
to the water supply soon.

391
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:11,762
We bred these superbugs.

392
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,991
They're our babies,
and they're all grown up,

393
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:18,434
and they've got body piercings
and a lot of anger.

394
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:23,964
On the other hand, maybe antibiotics
had nothing to do with it.

395
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:30,136
Did you notice how low
his B.P. was at the end,
even with three pressors?

396
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:32,308
Heart damage?

397
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:39,379
Go home. There's nothing more
you can do tonight.

398
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,601
Baby Boy Chen-Lupino.

399
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:07,782
Time of death-- 6:57 p.m.,
Thursday, December 2, 2004.

400
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:42,886
This is a cross section
of the Chen-Lupino boy's myocardium.

401
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:46,287
Fibrosis, lymphocytic infiltrates.

402
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:49,190
There was no sign of lymphocytosis
in the blood tests.

403
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,525
Yes, well, we all had plenty
of good reasons to think bacterial.

404
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:54,531
Nobody is scolding you.

405
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:57,363
Unfortunately,
all those clever reasons were wrong.

406
00:28:57,435 --> 00:28:59,528
It is a virus
infecting their hearts.

407
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:02,004
Then we're screwed.
We can't chase down
a virus.

408
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:05,975
There's a thousand possibilities.
We could run gels, antibody tests.

409
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:08,638
A thousand of them?
The kids don't have enough blood.

410
00:29:08,713 --> 00:29:12,706
Chase, you're the intensivist.
How many could we do before
we risk exsanguinating the kids?

411
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:16,720
You're talking vials, not stick tests?
I wouldn't take more than five or six.

412
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:22,488
Okay, so we have to narrow
the thousand viruses down to six.

413
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,326
Now, the autopsy's shown us
what the virus does.

414
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:28,388
So, let's go.
What do we know?

415
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:30,730
That ribavirin and acyclovir
don't knock it out.

416
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:35,330
- Cross out the herpes viruses.
- Also adenovirus.

417
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:37,237
What else? What else?
Keep talking!

418
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:39,606
Well, i-it only seems
to hit children.

419
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:43,169
- The mothers aren't sick, so--
- No toxoplasmosis, no rubella.

420
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:45,375
Cross out the entire
TORCH syndrome.

421
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,077
- You didn't find any lung damage?
- No.

422
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:50,918
- None of the paramyxoviridae.
- Cardiac scarring, people.

423
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:52,581
C.M.V.

424
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:57,928
Enteroviruses too, I think.

425
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:02,432
Eleven.
Influenza A.

426
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:05,993
Flu A.

427
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:09,263
Yes?

428
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,274
And?

429
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:25,220
I'm putting R.S.V. down as a yes.

430
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:28,249
That makes eight.

431
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:32,285
- Eight vials of blood is pushing it.
- Pushing it? Well, we love that.

432
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:34,627
Get the antibody kits,
start testing the sick kids.

433
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:38,066
All right, I'll look into whether
there are any antivirals for these eight.

434
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:43,267
Wait a second.
The kids on the floor who didn't get sick--
are any of them still in the hospital?

435
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:46,333
They got moved to the fifth floor,
but they're probably all
checked out by now.

436
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:48,971
No, the Limpert boy
had a bit of jaundice.
He's checking out today.

437
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:50,810
I want to test his blood too.
Why?

438
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:53,146
Because we need
all the information we can get.

439
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:54,947
The healthy kid
can be our control group.

440
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:58,978
I'll just tell his parents he can't check out
because he has the smallpox.

441
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:05,819
Stephen Morgan,
contact Hospital Administration.

442
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,668
Dr. Paul to the Recovery Room.

443
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:16,667
All done. All done.

444
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,645
What did we get?

445
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:25,171
Well, the sick babies
all tested positive for echovirus 11.

446
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,117
Great.
And C.M.V., and parvovirus B-19.

447
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:31,815
- Three viruses?
- But what's weirder,
the healthy kid we tested,

448
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:35,053
he's positive for echovirus 11
and C.M. V. antibodies as well.

449
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:43,366
They're infants.

450
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:47,097
They have their mother's blood,
their mother's antibodies.

451
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:49,162
So we've just learned nothing?
Uh-uh.

452
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,199
We have half the picture.
The healthy kids survived because
their mothers' antibodies saved them.

453
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:58,113
If the mom had C.M.V. in the past,
she'd have the antibodies for C.M.V.
The kid would be immune from it.

454
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:03,649
So, we test the sick kids' moms
for echovirus, C.M.V. and parvovirus.

455
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:08,055
And whichever
they don't have the antibodies for,
that's what's killing their kids.

456
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:10,117
I'll test the mothers.

457
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:34,077
Dr. Kent's office, one.
Dr. Kent's office, one.

458
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:55,901
Echovirus 11.

459
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,374
It's an enterovirus.
It lodges in the intestinal tract.

460
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:03,380
Enteroviruses cause diarrhea
and flu-like symptoms in adults,
maybe a rash,

461
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:06,042
but for newborns,
it can be deadly.

462
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:09,109
It's damaging her heart.

463
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:11,246
Well, is there anything
you can do?

464
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:14,780
Viruses are more difficult to treat
than bacterial infections.

465
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:17,123
We still haven't found a cure
for the common cold.

466
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:19,129
So, you mean there's no vaccine or--

467
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:22,064
There's a company in Pennsylvania
developing an antiviral.

468
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:24,124
It got positive results
in a lab setting.

469
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:26,932
We managed
to get our hands on it.

470
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:42,444
Imagine not being able
to touch your own baby.

471
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:49,284
Can I get your guys' help
with something?
Sure.

472
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,158
Your daughter, her--
Maxine.

473
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:55,631
That's her name-- Maxine.

474
00:33:57,201 --> 00:34:00,830
We need someone
to hold Maxine up off the bed
while the nurse changes her sheet.

475
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:02,839
Sure. Okay.

476
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:05,899
Shh, shh, shh.

477
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:08,605
Look at you. Hi.

478
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,670
Hold still.

479
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:18,112
That's it.

480
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:25,593
Hi. Easy. Shh.

481
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:27,824
There you go.

482
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:04,226
Hey, Foreman.

483
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:06,566
Got a minute?

484
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:16,970
So, pulmonary resistance
has stabilized for the two kids,
but, uh, B.P.'s still--

485
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:20,745
No news then.
How's Cameron?

486
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:23,582
Dr. Cameron?
Sure.

487
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:27,090
Let's start with her
and then move on to all
the other Camerons we know.

488
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:30,321
I'm sorry.
I'm just not used to you asking
about someone's well-being.

489
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:32,885
I can understand
how the question
would surprise you.

490
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,432
I don't quite get how it
would confuse you.

491
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,628
Why do you wanna know?
Why do you wanna know
why I want to know?

492
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:41,228
Just curious.
Me too.

493
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,239
You don't get curious.

494
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:46,242
I'm the most curious man
in the world.
Not about trivialities.

495
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:49,438
Well, then
this must not be trivial.

496
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:53,348
How is Cameron
handling everything?

497
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:55,442
Just fine.

498
00:35:57,722 --> 00:36:00,316
Great. Glad we talked.

499
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:09,698
Your husband is definitely
the source of your mono.

500
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:12,327
Oh. Wow!

501
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:14,667
Oh, thank God.

502
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:17,572
Wow. I'm gonna be a mom.

503
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:19,576
Whoa!

504
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:23,512
Thank you so much.
I gotta get you a gift
or something.

505
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:26,641
Sometimes the best gift
is the gift of never seeing you again.

506
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:28,878
Okay. All right.

507
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:32,650
But, Dr. House,
you've been so awesome.

508
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:37,092
I mean,
I really totally trust you.

509
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:39,391
Do you think you--
No.

510
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:41,431
Could do the prenatal--
No.

511
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:44,059
Or deliver the baby?
That would be "no".

512
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:46,831
Okay.

513
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:53,576
Wow.

514
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:32,780
Chase, take a look at this.

515
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:53,562
Oh, God. It's good news.

516
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:55,503
No. It's great.

517
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:02,268
Thank you.

518
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:15,586
Hi. She's doing great.

519
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,594
Hi, little girl.

520
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:23,666
Hello.

521
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:34,775
They all gone?
Hartigs are checking out
right now.

522
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,512
You look tired.
Thanks.

523
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:44,614
It's no wonder.
You've had a hard time
the last couple of days.

524
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:46,714
And you haven't?

525
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:48,782
Not like you.

526
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,991
Anyone who's that awkward...

527
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:58,229
either has no experience
with death or too much,

528
00:38:58,302 --> 00:39:00,793
and I'm pretty sure
it's not the former.

529
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:05,940
Chase told me about that idea you had,
the parents holding the baby.

530
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,001
Where'd you get that?

531
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:13,042
Did you lose someone?

532
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,710
Did you lose a baby?

533
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:21,414
You can be a real bastard.

534
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:26,721
Unfinished business?

535
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:28,725
I'm in the haystack.

536
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:31,626
Ah, because now you know
you're looking for a needle.

537
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:33,629
Right.

538
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:37,633
If I tell you to let it go,
it won't make any difference, will it?

539
00:40:37,701 --> 00:40:40,295
Enteroviruses
are spread by humans.

540
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:42,305
Fecal or oral usually.

541
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:44,967
It could be respiratory
secretions though.

542
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:48,034
So Cuddy got stool samples
from the whole staff.
Just wait till they come back.

543
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,046
That won't do it.
Why not?

544
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:54,380
The shedder, whoever he is,
he's so virulent, he must have
been symptomatic.

545
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,579
Cuddy would have
noticed him.
Hmm.

546
00:40:56,654 --> 00:41:00,283
And the babies didn't share
any common personnel.

547
00:41:00,357 --> 00:41:04,259
- That's what's weird.
- Yeah, yeah. That's what's weird.

548
00:41:04,328 --> 00:41:06,296
Transition Team to O.R. 2.

549
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:08,854
Transition Team to O.R. 2.

550
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:03,186
Can I help you?

551
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:11,391
You saved my life.
I just ran some tests.

552
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:14,625
Your will and determination
are what saved your life.

553
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:16,632
I know who I am now.
Yes, you do.

554
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,396
And I know who I am as well.

555
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:21,461
Naomi, I love you.

556
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,667
Hey, seriously, man.
You're not supposed to be here.

557
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:28,644
I'm performing a delivery.
You are?

558
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:31,203
A patient whose prenatal care
I've been handling.

559
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:33,443
I just took her on
a couple of minutes ago.

560
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:36,486
Ofcourse, I'll need one
of you two guys to supervise.

561
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,784
When's she due?
Late March.

562
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:43,392
That's five months
from now.

563
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:46,623
Thank God these chairs
are comfortable.
