1
00:00:06,806 --> 00:00:08,797
Jessica.

2
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:15,277
Jessica. Come on.
We gotta go.

3
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:21,078
- Move it or lose it, sister.
- I don't feel good.

4
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,758
Mmm. You don't feel warm.
My stomach hurts.

5
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:35,164
- Well, honey, if you don't have a fever--
- I don't wanna go to school.
I can do my work at home.

6
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:39,298
Jessica, what's wrong?

7
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:43,399
Everybody hates me.

8
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:47,069
Oh, they don't hate you.

9
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:50,344
They don't even know you
because they're too ignorant to try.

10
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:53,477
I hate myself.
Jessica, don't say that.

11
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:57,484
Oh, honey.
Look at me. Look at me.

12
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:02,688
You are a wonderful,
beautiful little girl.

13
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:07,961
Don't let a few bad apples--
A few? Try my whole class.

14
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:12,760
Remember the story
where the guy keeps saying
that he hates green eggs and ham?

15
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:15,433
And then at the end
he realized he really loved them?

16
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:18,773
One day, they're gonna realize
what a great kid you really are.

17
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:24,647
You just gotta be like Sam-I-Am.
And don't give up.

18
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:28,580
Okay.

19
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:35,418
That's it. Keep goin'.

20
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:40,296
Good. Nice.
You're doin' great, Jessica.
You're doin' great.

21
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:45,337
Hey. Hey, Seth.

22
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:48,033
- You wanna spend the rest of class
sittin' on the bench?
- No.

23
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,168
Keep goin', Jess.
You got 40 more seconds.

24
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:55,613
My arm hurts.
Come on. Tough it up.
You can do it. You can do it.

25
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:58,173
- My chest hurts.
- How do you think the ground feels?

26
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:00,446
Hey, Seth. Two laps. Bye.

27
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,081
Hey, Jess. It's just a stitch. Okay?
Just... keep breathin'. You got it.

28
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:06,148
I can't.

29
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,592
Only 10 more seconds.
You got it.

30
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:20,532
Jessica? Jessica?

31
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:23,440
Jessica!

32
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:30,771
Oh, my God. Hey, go to the office.
Get Miss Parsons. Now!

33
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:35,787
- I'm on the playground at Finley Elementary.
One of my students is havin' a heart attack.

34
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:39,916
Yeah, she's 10. Don't you think I know that?
Just send the damn ambulance.

35
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,621
Come on. Wake up.
Come on, sweetie.

36
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:22,124
Dr. Bender, call extension 2870.

37
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,638
You ever seen
an infected pierced scrotum?

38
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:30,642
Um, no, but I know a few people on whom
I'd like to see it happen. We need to talk.

39
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:34,146
Well, if pain's what you're after,
the penis is really the way to go.

40
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,876
- I'd recommend the apadravya.
- We're not talking.

41
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,815
Oh. It sounded like we were.

42
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:44,824
No, you're attempting to avoid talking
because you know what I wanna talk about.

43
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:48,657
Nipples?
You need to get rid of
one of your people.

44
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,959
Absolutely. As soon as
I do performance reviews.

45
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:54,056
And then review the reviews,
ofcourse.

46
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:57,330
A decision like this can't be made
without proper, you know, review.

47
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,564
Shouldn't take longer than a month,
maybe two.

48
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,073
Four at the most,
unless it gets complicated.

49
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:04,075
There's no way outta this.

50
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:07,579
You might as well get it over with as fast
as you can, like ripping off a Band-Aid.

51
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:10,309
Only instead of a two-cent piece of tape
and gauze, it's a human being.

52
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,783
- Like you care.
- Like you don't.

53
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:20,352
You have a week.
Get it done.

54
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:30,459
We have a referral
from Dr. Lenkiewicz.

55
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:32,970
- Don't know him.
- He knows you.

56
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,371
- What's the problem?
- Heart attack.

57
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:38,933
- Definitely don't know him.
- The patient's 10.

58
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:44,180
Ten-year-olds do not have heart attacks.
It's gotta be a mistake.

59
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:48,584
Right. Simplest explanation is
she's a 40-year-old lying about her age.

60
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:52,523
Maybe an actress
trying to hang on.
I meant maybe the tests were wrong.

61
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:55,425
That's what the E.R. thought.
Three C.K.-M.B.'s were positive.

62
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:58,953
The E.K.G. shows classic signs
of S. T. elevation. It's a heart attack.

63
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:03,025
She's morbidly obese.
The "morbid" part of that raises alarms.

64
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:05,593
Come on. It takes decades
to eat your way into a heart attack.

65
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:10,609
Doesn't take decades to kill yourself.
If I was that fat, I'd be pretty tempted
to knock back a bottle of pills.

66
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:16,377
It's not a drug overdose. The fatigue,
muscle pain and difficulty concentrating
have been bothering her for over a year.

67
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,280
That's because of her weight,
her depression.

68
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:21,377
That's what five pediatricians,
two nutritionists and a psychologist said.

69
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:24,389
The heart attack would seem to indicate
that they missed something.

70
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:27,551
- It's gotta be something genetic.
- What about metabolic syndrome "X"?

71
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:30,152
Insulin resistance?

72
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:32,925
Syndrome "X" could cause a stroke.
I don't know about a heart attack.

73
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:36,662
- It could, if her blood pressure was high enough.
- Which is likely, considering her weight.

74
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:42,333
Fits the symptoms. Me likee.
Do a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp.

75
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:46,939
Oh, and one more thing.

76
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:51,507
I've been told that I gotta get rid of
one of you guys by the end of the week.

77
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:56,680
New sheriff. Belt tightening.
You know how it goes.

78
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:02,750
Okay. Carry on.

79
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:09,958
Some kind of game.
House's own version of Punk'd.

80
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,970
It's not House. It's Vogler.

81
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,973
We can't let it get to us.
We've gotta stick together.
Why?

82
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,737
Are you suggesting
we start slashing each other's throats?

83
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:22,270
I'm suggesting it's a zero-sum game.
Your loss is my win.
That's not conducive to team play.

84
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:25,442
Which is what House seems to want.
Look, I'm with Cameron.

85
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:30,148
It may be a bad strategy,
but I don't wanna give House
that satisfaction.

86
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,659
Come on. Sick kid, remember?

87
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:36,991
She's diabetic?

88
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,156
No, but it's similar.

89
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,724
M.S.X. patients don't respond normally
to insulin, which causes
their body to create too much,

90
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:46,067
and that leads
to metabolic abnormalities.

91
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,040
We're going to do a test to be sure,
but there are certain dangers.

92
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:52,305
Is this... thing treatable?

93
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:54,642
It's controllable
through proper diet and exercise.

94
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:59,981
Wait. Jessica already eats right,
and she exercises every day.

95
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:02,486
I know you've already seen
several nutritionists--

96
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:06,047
- And we've done everything
they've recommended.
- I understand, but--

97
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:09,492
Why can't any of you doctors
see past her weight?

98
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:16,725
If diet and exercise are the treatment,
then the diagnosis is wrong.

99
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:22,332
It might be. But the only way we'll know
is if you let us do this test.

100
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:31,406
It's really bad, especially at night.
It's like my heart is on fire.
Like it's, um--

101
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:34,419
Oh, I don't know. Like, uh--

102
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:36,478
Burning?
Exactly.

103
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:40,356
Hmm, sounds almost like... heartburn.

104
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:44,294
So, can you
give me somethin'?
Like a thesaurus?

105
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:48,299
What?
I take it you never mentioned this
during any of your prenatal visits.

106
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:50,301
Prenatal?

107
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:52,837
I'm not pregnant.

108
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:57,205
Sorry, you don't get to make that call
unless you have a stethoscope. Union rules.

109
00:07:57,276 --> 00:08:00,109
I know when I'm pregnant, all right?
I have six kids.

110
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:03,706
That's why my husband
had a vasectomy, and we use condoms.

111
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:06,377
Vasectomies can reverse themselves.
Condoms break.

112
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:11,116
Okay. This... is what a woman
is supposed to look like.

113
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,159
Okay? We're not just
skin and bones.

114
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:17,492
We have... flesh.
We have... curves.

115
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:19,724
You have little people inside you.

116
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:23,726
Okay, okay.

117
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:27,671
I'm sorry. I guess I must have just been
brainwashed by the media...

118
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,731
and all those years of medical training.

119
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:33,973
- Damn right.
- I'll see if I can find some antacids
while the nurse gets some blood.

120
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:37,174
Blood? Why?

121
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,651
The heartburn.
Gotta make sure it's not... spreading.

122
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,420
I don't want to.

123
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:51,088
The test involves
some pretty precise measurements.

124
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:54,758
If we don't know exactly how much you weigh,
we won't get the right answers.

125
00:08:57,136 --> 00:09:01,869
Let me tell you a secret.
When I was your age, I was heavy too.

126
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,670
Were you over a hundred?

127
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:08,203
Way over. Kids in my neighborhood
used to call me "Rerun".

128
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:13,241
Rerun?
He was a heavy guy from TV.
I-- I used to pretend I liked it, but I didn't.

129
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:15,378
How come
you're not heavy anymore?

130
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:18,480
Ninth grade, grew five inches.
Everything kind of evened out.

131
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,883
You think that'll happen to me?
Well, yeah.

132
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:27,194
Your mom's tall,
and you are a little short for your age.
Probably spring right up.

133
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:40,268
Obesity isn't something
you just grow out of.

134
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:43,975
I take it you've never seen a baby?
She's not a baby. She's 10.

135
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,315
And you figure making her feel like crap
would do her a world of good?

136
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:51,516
- Yeah, if it gets her off the couch.
- I'm sure she's already
under enough pressure.

137
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,186
Not from Mummy.
Everything in society tells us
we have to be thin to be successful.

138
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:59,027
No. Society tells you you have to be thin
to be attractive. And guess what?

139
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:02,192
That's what attractive means,
that society likes looking at you.

140
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,999
I think we should be telling our kids
it's fine as long as they're healthy.
Right.

141
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:09,530
You weigh 90 pounds
because it makes you healthier?

142
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:14,410
Forget it. He's just cranky because he knows
he's the one who's gonna get the ax.

143
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:21,977
So, any thoughts?

144
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:24,955
On what? Sharon's plan for Gaza?

145
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:27,754
Who you gonna let go?

146
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:32,855
I'm thinking I can convince Vogler it would
be more cost-efficient to keep all of them.
Yeah, you should be able to pull that off.

147
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:35,457
Most billionaires
aren't very good with numbers.

148
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:41,200
It will be more cost-efficient
once I grab Cameron's ass,
call Foreman a spade, and Chase--

149
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:44,709
Well, I'll grab his ass too.

150
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:49,737
You are uniquely talented in many areas,
but office politics is not one of them.

151
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,045
Don't take Vogler on.

152
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:54,609
- Separate or together?
- Together.

153
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:02,058
Increasing glucose
to 6.9 milligrams per minute.

154
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:04,426
Are you okay?
- I'm thirsty.

155
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,125
-Just a little bit longer,
and you'll be done.
- Like Dr. Chase.

156
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:09,292
Wanna put some money on it?

157
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,905
I said I'm thirsty.
Just five more minutes.

158
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,670
Okay, sweetheart?
I'm not your sweetheart.
Don't call me that.

159
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:20,337
-Jessica, that's not nice.
- They're the ones who aren't nice.

160
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:23,246
Jessica.
You're not, either.
I don't wanna do this anymore.

161
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:25,647
Jessica. Jessica,
you have to calm down.
No! No!

162
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,686
Let me go.

163
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:29,744
Check her blood sugar.
She's gotta be getting hypoglycemic.

164
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:32,848
I've never seen her like this before.
Something's wrong.

165
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:35,758
Let go of me!
Get it out of me!

166
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:39,320
Let go of me, you son of a bitch!
You bastard!

167
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:43,425
Oh, no.

168
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:48,172
She's sedated.
Mrs. Simms, don't worry.

169
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,200
Hypoglycemia can cause temporary psychosis
and is a common complication
during an H.E.C. procedure.

170
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,338
I never wanted it done
in the first place.

171
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:58,508
We understand you're upset--
You were supposed
to be monitoring her condition,

172
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:00,643
but instead you were bickering
and placing bets.

173
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,884
I apologize if it looked like
we weren't devoting our full attention
to your daughter, but I assure you--

174
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:09,189
Oh, please. Save your pathetic insincerity
for your boyfriend.

175
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:13,698
You're wrong.
She is, in fact, pathetically sincere.
And they didn't screw it up.

176
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:16,701
- Who are you?
- I'm from the lab.

177
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:22,435
The blood tests show your daughter was not
hypoglycemic, which means her psychosis
wasn't caused by anything these doctors did.

178
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:26,467
- So then what was it caused by?
- I've no idea.

179
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:30,208
Huh.
But you'll be happy to hear
it cannot be cured by diet or exercise.

180
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:46,525
What else could cause
uncontrollable rage in a 10-year-old?

181
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,567
Nothing that could
also cause a heart attack.

182
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:56,373
I assume I don't have to point out
that now would be an extremely good time...

183
00:12:56,442 --> 00:13:00,503
for one of you to distinguish yourself
with a brilliant idea.

184
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,510
A hypercoagulable state
can cause a blood clot.

185
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:11,989
- Blood clots can cause a heart attack.
- More likely to cause a stroke,
not the psychosis.

186
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:16,756
No, you're wrong. If a clot made it
to the amygdala area of the brain,
it might cause uncontrollable rage.

187
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:20,458
Right, because anything's possible,
but nothing's gonna cause multiple clots
in a kid this age.

188
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:23,764
- She's fat.
- Obesity doesn't cause blood clots.

189
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:25,895
Extremely obese patients
can get a fat embolus.

190
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,838
Right, after they've had liposuction,
which she's clearly never had.

191
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:31,706
- How do you know?
- Because we have her medical records,

192
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:35,713
and because no plastic surgeon in his right
mind is gonna give a 10-year-old liposuction.

193
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:38,648
Have you ever met a plastic surgeon
who was in their right mind?

194
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:43,144
- She hasn't had liposuction.
- Thank you.

195
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,091
But what about some other
ridiculous obesity treatment?

196
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,890
Like what?
Diet pills can cause heart attacks
and blood clots.

197
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:55,423
- Her tox screen was negative.
- Wouldn't show over-the-counter
weight loss drugs.

198
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:59,062
Her mother wouldn't give her diet pills.
She thinks her daughter's perfect
just the way she is.

199
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:01,436
She's lying.

200
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:06,041
Okay. You two, heparin
and warfarin to prevent further clotting.

201
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,537
And you find those pills.

202
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,289
Not diet pills.

203
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:25,920
You might wanna broaden
the search just a little.

204
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:28,364
And don't just ask the mom.

205
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:32,427
If she hasn't mentioned it yet, she's not--
If you're gonna fire someone,
go ahead and do it.

206
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:37,601
But don't treat us like lab rats,
testing how long it takes
to get us at one another's throats.

207
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:39,974
- So what should I do?
- I don't give a damn what you do.

208
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:44,277
Yes, I had noticed
your complete indifference.

209
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,217
You don't even offer
a medical opinion anymore.

210
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:51,222
- Who would you fire?
- Not my call.

211
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,520
I want your opinion.

212
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:56,356
Fine, it's you.

213
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:59,022
Either way,
you're making a choice.

214
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,668
Chase.

215
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:08,702
- Because he screwed up an angio
a month ago?
- Anyone can make a mistake.

216
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:12,972
Right. So it's the money.
You resent it, but you're gonna tell me
that he doesn't need the job.

217
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:15,138
He doesn't appreciate the job.

218
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:18,240
He was ready to go three rounds
with Cameron for it.

219
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:21,150
He wants the job.
He just doesn't appreciate it.

220
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:26,021
There's nothing wrong
with just wanting to hang out,
but this is not the place to do it.

221
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,925
- I'm surprised.
- You thought I'd pick Cameron?

222
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:33,089
I didn't think you'd pick at all.

223
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:42,806
Guess he's not the "rise above the fray" guy
he'd like us to think he is.

224
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,866
You practically forced it out of him.

225
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,811
He's scared of losing his job,
just like everybody else.

226
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,849
I've been thinking. You've made it quite
clear that you're miserable here.

227
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:54,181
I am not miserable.
You're not happy.

228
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:57,620
And you are?
With my job, yes.

229
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:00,921
I am exactly where I wanna be,
doing exactly what I wanna do.

230
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:04,258
Think I sense a hint of sarcasm there.

231
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:09,427
Why don't you pick yourself? Quit?
Hmm, I was wrong.

232
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:13,961
About Vogler or Foreman?
Mrs. Hernandez's pregnancy test.

233
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:19,102
Who's Mrs. Hernandez?
Either a woman carrying an alien baby
or your newest patient.

234
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:24,139
So you never saw her with any pills.
She never mentioned anything?

235
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:26,514
No, ofcourse not.

236
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:29,383
Would it be all right if I, uh,
talk to a couple of her friends?

237
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:31,423
Her friends?
I'm not gonna interrogate them.

238
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,755
I just wanna ask if Jessica
ever mentioned anything.

239
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,886
It's-- It's pretty important.
She's very sick.

240
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:39,692
I understand. It's just, well--

241
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:41,960
Jessica really
doesn't have any friends.

242
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:44,264
Not one?
I've tried to help,

243
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,804
make the kids include her more,
but... kids can be--

244
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:49,238
- Kids?
- I was gonna say jerks.

245
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,709
All the fifth-graders are assigned
an eighth-grade buddy.

246
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,713
Maybe you could talk to hers.

247
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,854
What's the status on House?

248
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:07,756
He asked for time to complete performance
reviews for everyone in his department.

249
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:09,817
And you told him no
and gave him how long?

250
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:12,921
A week. He'll do it.

251
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:17,526
Guy's never done what he's told.
I don't see why he's gonna start now.

252
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,865
Hi. Edward Vogler.

253
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:23,999
Is Dr. House claiming that
I'm forcing him to get rid of one of you?

254
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:26,772
I assume his goal is to stir up
antagonism toward me.

255
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:31,509
- And your goal is?
- I am forcing him.

256
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,848
I'll do whatever I can to ease
the transition for whoever he chooses.

257
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,856
- If you're feeling guilty about your decision,
there is an easy solution.
- I don't feel guilty.

258
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:42,519
Then... why approach me
and tell me all this?

259
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:45,256
I don't feel guilty.
That doesn't mean I don't feel bad.

260
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,730
I'm rich, but I'm still human.

261
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:50,968
I just wanted you to know...

262
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:55,132
that if there's anything
I can do for you, my door's open.

263
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:57,334
Thank you.

264
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:08,148
You're lookin' for info?
Thought you already
had House all figured out.

265
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,348
I do. Don't know his team though.

266
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:16,991
The ultrasound and biopsy
confirmed our worry.

267
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:21,362
The tumor is extremely large,
at least 30 pounds.

268
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:24,527
Oh, God.
It's actually a personal record
for this clinic.

269
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:28,232
But it's completely benign.
There's no sign of cancer at all.

270
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:33,503
I've already spoken
with Dr. Bergin, and he's available
first thing in the morning.

271
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:35,513
For what?

272
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:39,450
For the surgery.

273
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:42,783
But if it's not cancer,
it can't kill me, right?

274
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:48,356
Mmm, no.
I'll have a huge scar.

275
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:51,260
I won't be able to wear a bikini.

276
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,766
- You wear a bikini now?
- Yeah. You got a problem with that?

277
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,768
Nope. But I've never
gone swimming with you.

278
00:18:57,836 --> 00:19:00,566
I knew it.
That's what this is all about.

279
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:04,405
You are trying to force me
to have cosmetic surgery.

280
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:08,469
Yeah, that's exactly why I planted
a 30-pound tumor on your ovary.

281
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:13,041
It's not gonna kill me. The only thing
surgery is gonna do is change the way I look.

282
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:17,145
That is the definition
of cosmetic surgery.

283
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:20,385
Uh, it would also relieve
your heartburn and discomfort.

284
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:24,122
Yeah, right. Why give an antacid
if you can cut someone up...

285
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:26,255
and make them
a little easier on your eyes?

286
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:33,566
My husband... loves my body.
He can't get enough of it.

287
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:37,973
You think he's gonna wanna touch me
if I look like I've been gutted like a fish?

288
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:42,780
That was unexpected.

289
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,741
Yeah, it was.

290
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,747
All she does during recess
is run laps around the playground.

291
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:54,849
She says she's exercising,
but everyone knows it's just because
no one wants to play with her.

292
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:58,454
I mean, I'm only her buddy
because Ms. Ayers assigned her to me.

293
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,521
That does not mean
I am her friend.

294
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:05,299
I'll make sure her doctors
are all clear on that.

295
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,304
Thanks.

296
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:10,671
So, has she ever said anything to you
about diet pills?

297
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:13,438
- Ha. She told you that too?
- What do you mean?

298
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,446
I totally busted her
for taking drugs one day.

299
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:19,041
She totally lied, said that they were
diet pills her mom had given her.

300
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:22,553
Come on. Get real.
No way a girl like that
is taking diet pills.

301
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,589
I didn't give her diet pills.
I would never do that.

302
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:28,592
Right. So it was
her imaginary mom.

303
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,628
She didn't take any pills.
The girl's lying.

304
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:33,790
Why would she lie?
Because she's another mean little jerk.

305
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:37,528
- Mom.
- I'm sorry, honey.

306
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:40,197
Clemmie didn't lie.

307
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,802
I did. I took the pills.

308
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:51,243
I told her you gave them to me
because I didn't wanna get in trouble.

309
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:55,377
Where did you get them?
I took them from the store.

310
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:59,247
Why? Why would you do that?

311
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:01,519
Because I didn't
wanna be ugly anymore.

312
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:05,552
- Oh, baby. You're not ugly.
- Yes, I am.

313
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:08,759
I know you don't think so,
but I am. I'm disgusting.

314
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:11,701
Jessica, please don't say that.

315
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:16,036
I just-- I just wanted to fit in.

316
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,042
You know, have friends?

317
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:22,171
Or at least have
one person my age be nice to me.

318
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:25,683
Oh.

319
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:30,287
Listen, the, uh--

320
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:34,018
The pills cause blood clots,
heart attacks and insomnia.

321
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:37,550
It explains everything.
We'll keep her overnight to make sure,

322
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:40,097
but, uh, she'll be fine.

323
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:43,623
Thank you.

324
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:46,136
I can't believe
she was that desperate.

325
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:49,071
Yeah, I'm sure that if
everyone I knew hated me,

326
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:52,201
couldn't bear to look at me,
I wouldn't go so far as to shoplift.

327
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:55,872
I'm not talking about the shoplifting.
I'm sure she didn't even know
they were dangerous.

328
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:59,383
She probably saw them advertised
on TV or over the Internet.

329
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:03,353
Right. So I guess it's the media
and pharmaceutical companies' fault now,

330
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:05,982
not the fact that she can't stop shoveling
food down her throat.

331
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:07,992
No one forced her to get fat.

332
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,461
- No one forced a cancer patient
to get cancer.
- Give me a break. It's not a disease.

333
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:14,090
Have you seen the latest research?
Yes, I have.

334
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:18,102
What I haven't seen lately
is a kid eating an apple or riding a bike.

335
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,571
You Americans can't even compete with
the rest of the world in basketball anymore,

336
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:26,339
unless, ofcourse, it's the type you play
with a remote control on a big-screen TV.

337
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:29,471
- Right.
- Wait, wait, wait.

338
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:34,178
Are you gonna let him say that?
He insulted our basketball teams.

339
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:47,590
Oh, my God.

340
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,834
It hurts so bad. Please.
What happened?

341
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:53,302
- She's bleeding.
- From where?

342
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,932
Oh, my gosh.

343
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:58,635
Just please stop it.
Please!

344
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:09,309
Diet pills brought her to us.
We gave her the sores.

345
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,948
You think she got a staph infection
from something here?

346
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:15,049
I'm not saying the hospital
gave her the sores.
I'm saying we did, by treating her.

347
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:18,221
Warfarin-induced skin necrosis.

348
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:21,959
- Highly unlikely. We started her
on heparin before the warfarin.
- Who gave her the heparin?

349
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:25,400
- I did warfarin. She did heparin.
- Sure you didn't both give her warfarin?

350
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,461
Yes. I did not screw up.

351
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:33,376
Did you actually see her prepare
and administer the heparin?

352
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:39,712
'Nuff said.

353
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:42,913
You were standing right there.
I was preparing my own dose.

354
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:47,652
- Yeah, right.
There's gotta be some other cause.
- None that I can think of.

355
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:50,217
Let's fix the mistake.

356
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:54,459
Give her unfractionated I. V. heparin
and low molecular weight heparin
by subcutaneous injection, stat.

357
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,498
Making me look bad
is not gonna save your job.

358
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:04,701
You think you're incapable
of making a mistake?

359
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,937
You think that I'm just
gonna roll over and take this?

360
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:09,446
House isn't gonna protect you
just because you kiss his ass.

361
00:24:09,514 --> 00:24:12,278
Vogler wants to know
what he can do for me.

362
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:17,310
Hey! Stop worrying about your asses
and start worrying about the patient's.

363
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:38,999
She sleeping?

364
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:42,376
As a result of the sedatives, yeah.
Can't let her wake up. Too much pain.

365
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:50,781
"Warfarin-induced skin necrosis".

366
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:53,689
I... have no idea what that means.

367
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:57,956
But it says here
we gave her the warfarin.

368
00:24:58,029 --> 00:25:01,897
And I do know what "induced" means.
We did this?

369
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:05,733
At this point,
it's not exactly clear.

370
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:09,667
You should probably talk
to Dr. House.

371
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:12,972
Oh. You two need time
to get your stories straight.

372
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:15,035
He doesn't tell me what to do.

373
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:18,879
So you don't just blindly follow
his commands. You're your own man.

374
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:22,909
And yet here you are,
working for a guy you can't stand.

375
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:25,548
I respect him.
What exactly is it you respect?

376
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:29,583
His attitude toward humanity?
He thinks we're all idiots and liars.

377
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:33,427
How about his attitude toward you?
Plays with you like a cat
with a ball of string.

378
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:37,491
What do you want?
I wanna know
if you wanna keep your job.

379
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:39,662
If he chooses to let me go,
I can live with that.

380
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:42,206
- That's not an answer.
- Are you offering to protect me?

381
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:44,742
- Still not an answer.
- I want my job.

382
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,779
Dr. Chase.
Boss.

383
00:25:57,222 --> 00:26:02,159
What was that about?
He wanted to know
what warfarin is. I don't know.

384
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,679
Brr. Icy.

385
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:35,386
I'll definitely think twice before
correcting one of your mistakes again.

386
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:39,123
Correct all you want.
Course, it's a bit more productive
if there's an actual mistake.

387
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:42,792
Right. I always forget that part.

388
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:46,826
I gave her the heparin,
which means the necrosis
is not a reaction to the warfarin,

389
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:51,638
which is probably why
she's not responding to your treatment.
Yet.

390
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:57,443
If you didn't screw up,
then what is it?

391
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:02,348
You don't have an answer.
Yet.

392
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,082
When you come up with something,
let me know.

393
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:08,922
I'll be in the clinic, warming up.

394
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:12,452
I'm the only one
who's always stood behind you
when you've screwed up.

395
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:14,657
Why? Why would you
support someone who screws up?

396
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:18,726
Because I'm not insanely insecure,
and because I can actually trust
in another human being,

397
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,738
and I am not an angry,
misanthropic son of a bitch.

398
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:25,037
I'm sorry.
You said you weren't angry.

399
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:30,173
Who would you fire?

400
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:32,773
No one.

401
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:34,819
Not an option.

402
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:39,380
If everyone took a pay cut and put in
a few more hours, we could all stay
for the same amount of money.

403
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:42,620
Figures you'd try and come up with
a solution where no one gets hurt.

404
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:45,959
The problem is, the world doesn't work
that way just 'cause you want it to.

405
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:49,000
Figures you'd stall
and refuse to deal with the issue.

406
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:52,559
Problem is, the world doesn't go away
just because you want it to.

407
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:11,846
Excuse me. Dr. House?

408
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:15,017
My wife saw you yesterday.
Lucille Hernandez?

409
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:17,061
Uh, he's not in today.

410
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:19,756
My wife said
he walked with a cane.

411
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:24,097
He's also got a bit of a drug problem.
Sometimes doesn't show up for weeks.

412
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:28,765
The M.R.I.'s are rented, but, um--

413
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:33,074
Did you make a decision?
He's not gonna fire anybody.

414
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:37,240
Yes. I'm gonna cut the pay
of all four of us.

415
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:41,843
Seventeen percent across the board
will allow you to keep us all
for the same amount of money.

416
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,911
I believe it's what
you suits call a "win-win".

417
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:48,354
All right, uh, i-if you can--
No.

418
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:51,623
If he can work it so we keep the current
staff for the same amount of money,

419
00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:54,290
what difference does it make?

420
00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:59,966
It's not about the money.

421
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:03,166
This is not a negotiation.
It never was.

422
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,801
I need to know that
whatever I ask you to do,

423
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:08,869
however distasteful
you find it, you'll do it.

424
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:11,973
And just as importantly,
you need to know that.

425
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,651
What's going on with my wife?

426
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:28,062
Even if I was Dr. House,

427
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:32,035
physician-patient confidentiality
protects me from annoying conversations.

428
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:36,199
She told me about the tumor.
Yeah? She also tell you
why she's refusing to have it removed?

429
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:40,233
I don't care about a scar.
And she can always gain the weight back.

430
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:46,272
- You want her to regain the weight?
- Yeah. I mean, only if she wants to.

431
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:50,617
Why?
I've always thought she looked sexiest
when she was pregnant.

432
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:54,920
Something about knowing
she's a mother just makes me want to--
Tell her that and leave me alone.

433
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:59,521
I did. You gotta talk to her. I couldn't
bear it if something happened to her.

434
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:03,431
The tumor is benign.
Nothing's gonna happen,
except maybe some more heartburn.

435
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:07,030
What if it gets even bigger,
or it changes?

436
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:10,268
You know where to find us.
Building's not going anywhere.

437
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:16,007
Tell her it's cancer. You obviously
don't have a problem with lying.
Oh. Way to win me over.

438
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,572
We got six kids.
She can't afford to take a chance.

439
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:22,279
You have kids. How novel.
That changes everything.

440
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:24,947
So if Mommy gets heartburn,
one of them might catch on fire.

441
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:29,460
Please. I don't know what we'd do.

442
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:38,365
They are cute.

443
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:40,529
Have her come back in.
What?

444
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:43,733
Your plight has moved me.
Tell your wife to come back.

445
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:52,516
The necrosis is getting worse.

446
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:55,052
Maybe because we're treating her
for the wrong thing.

447
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:58,885
- Have you found the right thing?
- No.

448
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:02,688
Then we continue the treatment,
hope it's just taking longer
than it should.

449
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,729
At this point, it doesn't matter
what caused the necrosis.

450
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:09,858
- Or who.
- If we don't stop it from spreading,
it'll kill her before the end of the day.

451
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:14,371
What else can we do?
Get rid of it. Remove the dying flesh
before it penetrates the abdominal wall.

452
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:18,265
Do it.

453
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:22,642
There's still a chance the heparin
treatment could start to take effect.

454
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:26,172
We're gonna wait as long as we can,
but if there's no change
in the next few hours,

455
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:28,515
we're gonna have to treat
the symptoms directly.

456
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:31,885
So you can get rid of the sores?
Through surgery.

457
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:35,050
Technically, it's an amputation.

458
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:38,220
Amputation? But the sores are--

459
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:43,097
Warfarin-induced necrosis
attacks fatty tissue,
mainly in the breasts.

460
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:48,799
Wait. Are you talking about cutting off
my daughter's... breasts?

461
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:57,911
- She's 10 years old.
-A radical mastectomy
may be her only chance for survival.

462
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:03,578
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna
have to ask you to sign this.

463
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:19,962
Could we talk?

464
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:25,534
What, no roses, no chocolates?

465
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,545
If you're here to apologize--
I'm not here to apologize.

466
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:31,343
Uh-oh.

467
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,211
That means you're here
for something more complicated.

468
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:38,119
Do you want to fire me?

469
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:44,624
Yes. Just waiting for an excuse.
Thank God Vogler came along. Whew.

470
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:48,462
It's the only reason I can think of why
you're insisting that I made a mistake.

471
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:51,991
Really? Because there is
another explanation.

472
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,300
Perhaps not as much fun
as your Freudian analysis,

473
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:56,363
but maybe you actually
made a mistake.

474
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:59,535
You're doing this because
you can't deal with your feelings for me.

475
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:09,244
I believe that you are
the only one to express feelings.

476
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,882
And if we're gonna look at this
from a first-year psych point of view,
maybe you want me to fire you.

477
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:16,722
Maybe that's why
you're acting weird--
You're the one being different.

478
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:19,786
You're always pushing things,
pushing the rules, pushing us.
But not this time.

479
00:33:19,864 --> 00:33:23,061
You jumped on this idea
like a life raft. Not one question
about what else it could be.

480
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:27,093
No riding us for other answers.
I have the answer.

481
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:32,766
Then why aren't you watching TV
or playing your damn Game Boy...

482
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,677
or whatever else you have
so much fun doing by yourself?

483
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:41,178
Maybe I should just quit.

484
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,380
Make it easy for everyone.

485
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:47,447
Maybe you should.

486
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:55,589
Men are pigs.

487
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:57,725
You called me in to tell me--

488
00:33:57,802 --> 00:34:02,762
I should've realized the vasectomy
and condoms was overkill,
but this was too obvious to miss.

489
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:06,971
Cute kids.

490
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:11,243
Love her green eyes
and his baby blues.

491
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:15,251
- Ofcourse, since both you
and your husband have brown eyes--
- Where'd you get that?

492
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:20,382
From the father of three, maximum four,
of your six children.

493
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:22,790
So I'm thinking maybe
the reason you don't want surgery...

494
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:25,727
is that while your husband will
find you attractive no matter what,

495
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:29,927
all the other men you're sleeping with
might not be so open-minded.

496
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:33,664
Which brings me back
to my original thesis: Men are pigs.

497
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:39,142
You got nothing to worry about.
They'll pretty much
have sex with anyone:

498
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:44,671
fat, skinny, married, single,
complete strangers, relatives--

499
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:48,344
You... are sick.
So are you.

500
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:51,115
And I'm sure there are Web sites
full of men...

501
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:54,090
looking for married women
with surgical scars.

502
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:59,653
So have the surgery. Please?

503
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:02,426
Okay.

504
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:10,564
Thanks.

505
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:16,377
Why have you
been talking to Cameron?

506
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:20,645
- If House picks you,
I'll be needing a new source in that room.
- If he picks me?

507
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:25,781
Sure. Foreman's smarter.
House has got a thing for Cameron.

508
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:28,553
I've been feeding you information
so you'll protect me.

509
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,719
And I will protect you
as long as I need you.

510
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,059
And you will feed me information
as long as you need me.

511
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,998
I spoke with Cameron
because if I have alternatives,

512
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:39,002
I don't need you.

513
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:44,704
She's not gonna rat on House.

514
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:47,573
Foreman never said anything
about talkin' to me?

515
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:53,244
Interesting, huh?

516
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:16,765
It's been almost three hours.
Still no change in her condition.

517
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,833
I think we should
get her into surgery.

518
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:21,970
So what do you wanna do?

519
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:27,581
Assume that Cameron
didn't screw up.

520
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:33,153
What if it's not the warfarin?
It has to be. The sores presented
right after we administered it.

521
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:37,456
Right, right, right. But let's just say it's not.
Come on. Come on. What do you got?

522
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:42,192
Can I have a second to think?
No. There's no time to think. Just say
the first thing that comes into your head.

523
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:44,962
She's fat.
Enough already, okay?
We got it. You hate fat people.

524
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:48,267
That's not what I meant.
We already considered obesity
as a cause.

525
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:52,207
So did all her other doctors.
No, I mean what if it's not a cause?
What if it's a symptom?

526
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:58,571
Okay. So, what could cause obesity
and skin necrosis?

527
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:02,986
I don't care if it makes sense.
Just give me something.

528
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:07,388
- Ulcers secondary to vasculitis.
- No, that's just sores, not obesity.

529
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:09,983
- Pyoderma gangrenosum.
- More sores.

530
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:13,997
Let's look at it from the other side.
What has obesity as a symptom?

531
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:17,501
Hypothyroidism?
Genetics are more likely.
Her mom's heavy too.

532
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:25,967
She's not just heavy, she's tall.

533
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,406
We have any history
on the dad?
Yeah.

534
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:33,507
6'1 ".

535
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,389
Kid's short.

536
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:44,019
We got stunted growth,
high blood pressure, blood clots, obesity--

537
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:48,258
- It's Cushing's.
- No. Necrosis doesn't present--

538
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:51,165
In rare cases,
Cushing's can cause hypercalcemia,

539
00:37:51,235 --> 00:37:54,033
which can lead
to the same skin necrosis as warfarin.

540
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,471
It's perfect.
It explains everything.

541
00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:01,443
Except it's not Cushing's.
She's had multiple blood tests,
and none show abnormal cortisol levels.

542
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:04,811
The hypercortisolism could be cyclical.
We didn't catch it in the right phase.

543
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:08,978
- We'll have to do another U.F.C.--
- There's no time. We've got
less than an hour to make a call.

544
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:11,385
If we treat for Cushing's
and we're wrong, she's dead.

545
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:14,856
If we assume it's not Cushing's,
she'll lose her breast and may still be sick.

546
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:22,325
- Do an M.R.I.
- You want us to look
for hypercortisolism with an M.R.I.?

547
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,632
No, I want you to look for what could
cause hypercortisolism with an M.R.I.

548
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,819
Nothing on the adrenals.

549
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:53,722
Heard Cameron went home.
Is she sick?

550
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:56,323
Go back to the pituitary views.

551
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,528
- She seemed okay.
- Think she's got
another reason for leaving?

552
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:01,901
I hope so. Wait, stop.

553
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:04,406
There. What's that?

554
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:11,370
Huh. A tumor.

555
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:13,440
It's Cushing's.

556
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:18,511
The tumor causes Cushing's.
Cushing's messes with hormone production.

557
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:20,921
Hormones control everything:
growth, weight--

558
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:24,950
Can you fix it?
She'll need surgery
to remove the tumor.

559
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:28,294
Once it's gone,
everything will get normal very fast.

560
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,766
- No mastectomy?
- No.

561
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:33,633
Thank God.
The surgery is dangerous.

562
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:36,002
The pituitary's located
between the cavernous sinuses,

563
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:38,064
basically right between the eyes.

564
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:41,634
The area contains the nerves
that control eye movement and
the major arteries that feed the brain.

565
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,577
Oh, my God.

566
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:47,276
The surgeon will approach
the gland transsphenoidally.

567
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:49,979
An incision will be made
under the lip,

568
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:53,217
through which he'll insert
a fiber-optic microscope.

569
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:57,784
Once the tumor's found, he'll cut it
into small pieces and remove it
through the same hole under the lip.

570
00:39:57,862 --> 00:40:02,299
The whole procedure should take
about three hours, and your daughter
should be able to go home in a few days.

571
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:05,563
The sores will go away, as well as
her fatigue and the muscle pain.

572
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:08,628
She'll even start losing weight.

573
00:40:58,055 --> 00:41:00,046
Jessica.
Hi.

574
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:03,821
- Is that really you?
- Yep, it's me.

575
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:06,727
You look fantastic.

576
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:10,893
- She always looked fantastic.
- Yeah.

577
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:41,888
- It's been a week.
- Actually, it's over a week.

578
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:43,957
How have you guys been?

579
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:46,025
Who is it?

580
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,165
Chase.

581
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:58,071
No, Chase stays.
Pick someone else.

582
00:41:58,148 --> 00:42:01,276
The deal was--
The deal's changed.

583
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:05,550
- Pick someone else.
- No.

584
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,186
Mmm.

585
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,625
Pick someone else,
or it'll be the whole department.
