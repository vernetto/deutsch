1
00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:05,694
It's all about the tongue, man.
You stick it in their mouth,

2
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:09,575
but not all the way.

3
00:00:09,642 --> 00:00:12,577
They like that?
Dude, they love it.

4
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:16,975
What are you doing?
Climbing.

5
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:25,016
Just deep enough to lick her teeth:
slow, one at a time,
like you're painting them.

6
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:28,060
This girl Rachel, she's a junior.

7
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:31,564
- She's experienced.
- Mom says I gotta be home by 5:00.

8
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:36,068
Just chill, okay? And hop the fence
before someone sees you.

9
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:48,578
Are you sure this is okay?
Dave's mom's a Realtor.
If it's for sale and empty, it's a clubhouse.

10
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:52,948
And if you say anything, you're dead.

11
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:58,252
I told them you were cool.
These are very serious dudes.

12
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:02,385
Come on.

13
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:05,761
Cub Scout meeting's
down the street, boys.

14
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,667
What a loser.
Lame.

15
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,764
- Gabe's cool, man.
He's one of us.
- He better be.

16
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:21,272
Uh, I'm not thirsty.

17
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:26,247
- What's this?
- Club business, little man.

18
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,981
- What shall we ask?
- Put your hands on.

19
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:36,695
O dark spirit, will any of us die
in the year to come?

20
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:47,271
- You're moving it.
- Put your hands back. Now.

21
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:54,973
Who among us will die?

22
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:04,815
"G",

23
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,553
"A"--

24
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,495
Oh, man.

25
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,692
"B",

26
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,240
"E".

27
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:25,641
"Gabe".
That blows.

28
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:35,512
That's it. We're going to the hospital.

29
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:41,185
- No, Mom. I'm too tired.
- Come on, sweetie.
You've had a fever for almost a week now.

30
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,598
- Ow.
- Oh, my God.

31
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,571
Oh, Gabe.
Are you okay?

32
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,167
Are you okay?
Baby, what's wrong?

33
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:02,044
I'm dying.

34
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:51,691
Twelve-year-old male.
Spiking fever, congested chest,

35
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:53,959
coughing up green sputum,
pain in breathing.

36
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:59,266
Baffling, though I vaguely recall a disease
called "meunomia"? "Pneumania"?

37
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:04,572
But his chest X-ray and C.T. scan
show an atypical pattern for pneumonia.
Pneumonia! That's it.

38
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:07,738
Just a guess here,
but his parents big donors?

39
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:11,272
No infiltrate,
just enlarged hilar lymph nodes.

40
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:14,843
Tiny unicorns goring his bronchial tubes
would be cooler,

41
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:19,654
and the way you're ignoring the question--
wow, they're extremely big donors.

42
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:24,561
He's not responding to cefuroxime,
his pulse ox is dropping much faster
than it should for pneumonia,

43
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:26,622
and plus he's got
an odd little rash.

44
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,100
Excessive irritation.
He's 12. He's on auto-stroke.
On his arm.

45
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:33,764
Papular lesion, one centimeter,
on top of a long, thin scab.

46
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,073
Ah, you need a dermatologist.
If it's dry, keep it wet.
If it's wet, keep it dry.

47
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:42,342
If it's not supposed to be there, cut it off.
I never could master all that.

48
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:45,009
There you are.

49
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:48,417
Were you scared?
It's okay. You're home now.

50
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:50,422
Fine.

51
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,082
Cuddy.

52
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:59,961
- As a special favor to you--
- No. Admit it. I got you with the rash.

53
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:05,369
The rash is a total snooze,
unless it's connected to the pneumonia,

54
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:09,698
then it's party time.

55
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,506
Purulent sputum, dyspnea,
rhonchi bilaterally.

56
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:19,983
What kind of pneumonia
causes this kind of rash?
Legionnaire's disease.

57
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:23,489
Usually means industrial ventilation systems,
convention centers. He's 12 years old.

58
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:26,821
Send off a urine antigen and check
if he's joined the Elks. Next?

59
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:30,329
- Fungal.
- Excellent.
Maybe the lodge went spelunking.

60
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:33,490
- Chlamydia pneumonia.
- Twelve-year-olds don't have sex.

61
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:36,126
Their mistake.

62
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:39,399
That's it?
Other possibilities?

63
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:44,910
- What if we're thinking about this backwards?
- The rash came first, caused the pneumonia. Nice.

64
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:49,641
Rickettsial. Tick bite.
Nymphal ticks are out now.
They're bloodthirsty little bastards.

65
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:53,413
- Rash would be more pustular.
- Not always,
and there's only one rash, which fits.

66
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:57,684
- New Jersey, it's most likely Lyme disease.
- All right. Let's keep him on fluids...

67
00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:59,816
and the cefuroxime to be safe.

68
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:02,884
Biopsy that rash.

69
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:06,056
And take another history.
Even if we don't learn what's causing this,

70
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:08,930
we definitely need to know
if twelve-year-olds are getting any action.

71
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:16,667
- What are you doing now?
- We're collecting fluids from the rash.

72
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:18,973
Why?
They know what they're doing, Jeffrey.

73
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:23,482
Oh, great endorsement coming from
the woman who thought it was a nasty cold.
If I had had him last week--

74
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,676
This isn't helping.

75
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:30,382
We're checking to see
if your son has a tick bite.

76
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:34,688
Gabe, have you been camping recently,
playing sports outside, anything like that?

77
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:36,695
I'm not that good at sports.

78
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:39,789
- No hanging out anywhere new,
strange places?
- We've been through this.

79
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:43,131
- We don't let him run wild
through the neighborhood, right?

80
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:49,241
Okay. This might be a bit delicate.

81
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,202
- We need to know if you're sexually active.
- I beg your pardon?

82
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,805
- Mr. Reilich, we need to--
- No.

83
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:00,585
Nothing like that.

84
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:06,353
We've gotta get another C.T. scan,
check his lungs again.

85
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,417
- Third floor, right?
- Yeah, Radiology is--

86
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:11,258
Sorry, medical personnel only.

87
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:17,168
Where's the machine?
Well, we passed it, actually.

88
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:21,104
A little tension in the room back there.
Thought you could use a break.

89
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:24,371
Your dad's a pretty... high-powered guy.

90
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:30,007
Yeah. He was an air force test pilot.
Real Top Gun stuff.

91
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:32,016
Flew Mach 3.

92
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:34,075
Hard to deal with sometimes?

93
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:37,714
Guess I'm more like my mom.
Listen.

94
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:42,785
I promise to keep my mouth shut,
but I need to know.

95
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:47,026
You definitely haven't had
any sexual contact
of any kind?

96
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,033
I wish.

97
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:51,092
You know what?

98
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:54,196
Girls like the cool guys now,
but give it a few years.

99
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:56,707
They start liking the smart guys.

100
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:59,074
You'll be all right.

101
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:03,274
Can you keep a secret?

102
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,342
I have to. It's my job.

103
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:12,891
I'm cursed. I'm not kidding.

104
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:17,760
This sÃ©ance thing the kids did?
It spelled out my name.

105
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,162
Said I was gonna die.

106
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:24,761
First name and last name?
We've got a Gabe upstairs
who's very old, very sick.

107
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:28,705
No. It's me.
I have the worst luck.

108
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:31,937
One time I broke this mirror,

109
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,479
the next week
my parents got separated.

110
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:37,448
My parents split up too.

111
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:42,250
Every kid feels like it's his fault.
It never is.

112
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:46,587
So, what about the rest of the stuff?
Any playing outside
your parents don't know about?

113
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:48,593
Anything like that?

114
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:52,358
Maybe you were somewhere
you weren't supposed to be?

115
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:55,491
Triage nurse, pick up line 274.
Oh, man.

116
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:59,334
Gabe, it's important.

117
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:06,604
A secret club.
What's the secret-- they're all morons?

118
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:10,706
He fell on something in the attic,
scraped his arm,
got the rash the next day.

119
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:13,877
Said it smelled really moldy up there.

120
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:18,947
- Fungal pneumonia
without the cave. Clever.
- I'm gonna get a sample.

121
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:25,194
Dr. Chase,
you have a few moments?

122
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:29,867
Sorry, I've gotta go.

123
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,805
These young doctors.
It's like they don't care about people.

124
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:40,642
- No manners.
- My fault, probably.

125
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:46,515
That's an interesting accent
you have there. I'd say Czech...

126
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,679
with about 30 years of Aussie.

127
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,689
You have quite an ear.

128
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,248
You're Chase's dad.

129
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:59,921
Hard to miss-- you know, the big hug
and how happy he was to see you.

130
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,476
Need a consult.
With a patient.

131
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:14,035
Urgent doctor stuff.

132
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:19,982
Twenty-six-year-old male,
sudden loss of the ability to speak--

133
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:23,613
Just because you got out of clinic duty
doesn't mean everybody did.
To his father.

134
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:26,920
Differential diagnosis?
Chase?

135
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:29,427
Dad swoops in,
Chase swoops out.

136
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:32,396
Dad say why he was here?
See? You asked.

137
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,764
Dad comes 5,000 miles,
you're more curious than Junior is.

138
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:38,804
Can't just be about the divorce.

139
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:42,932
It's been 15 years, and Mom's
been dead for 10 of them.
You think Daddy murdered her?

140
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:46,069
You want to get to the bottom of this,
you're doing it exactly right:

141
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:50,809
Don't talk to the people involved.
Drag your buddy away from work
for some pointless speculation.

142
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:53,443
You want to know how
two chemicals interact,
do you ask them?

143
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,148
No. They're gonna lie through
their lying little chemical teeth.

144
00:10:57,223 --> 00:11:00,158
Throw them in a beaker
and apply heat.

145
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:02,592
Even I don't like you.

146
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,153
You know, words can hurt.

147
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:22,810
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, guys.
I don't care that you're up here.

148
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:28,550
- You a cop?
- Doctor. I'm treating Gabe Reilich.

149
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:33,285
- He said he fell over near some pipes?
- Yeah, over there.

150
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:36,260
- What, here?
- Yeah.

151
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:43,332
- Any of you guys been feeling sick lately?
Rash, cold, anything?
- No.

152
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:53,675
Oh, crap. He is a cop!
Damn it!

153
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:19,633
He fell on it--
some weird kind of insulation.

154
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:22,469
It's old.
House was built in the '60s.

155
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:26,534
What's it made of?
Felt, fibers of-- what, cotton?

156
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,384
Sorry. Forgotten how funny your dad was.

157
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:37,081
- Not as funny as you.
High praise.

158
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:41,024
I know how protective
kids can be of their parents.

159
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:49,257
Not cotton. Animal hair.

160
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,594
Get me the C.T. scan.

161
00:12:56,942 --> 00:13:00,969
First, find the name of the company
that made the insulation,

162
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:05,415
and second, tell me what I'm seeing
that makes me want to short their stock.

163
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:08,647
Uh, enlarged hilar lymph nodes.

164
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:11,019
Peribronchial thickening.
- Pleural effusions.

165
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:15,049
Less obvious, more scary.

166
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,527
Well, the mediastinum
doesn't look right.

167
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:20,087
Slightly widened.

168
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,657
Oh, God.

169
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:25,329
It can be transmitted
through infected animal hair.

170
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:30,068
But the Gram's stain would have shown--
No. The cefuroxime would have killed
some of it, clouded the result.

171
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,940
We've gotta get this kid on levaquin.

172
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:37,244
What does he have?

173
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:41,878
Anthrax. This house belong
to old man Hussein?

174
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:47,623
Maybe he is cursed.

175
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:04,506
Anthrax. So, what-- you think
there were terrorists in that attic?

176
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,807
It's a naturally occurring bacteria.

177
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,245
- We believe it was in the insulation.
- How sick is he?

178
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:14,981
Anthrax is very dangerous,
but we've caught it early. He's on levaquin.
It's the best antibiotic we have.

179
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:18,683
Lisa, you buy this?
Jeff, you've helped
our hospital a lot.

180
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:22,318
I wouldn't have assigned
Dr. House to your case
if I didn't have every confidence in him.

181
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:24,362
- Then who's this guy?
-Jeffrey!

182
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:28,389
There's all these weird diseases
that can cause a rash.
What about leishmaniasis or filariasis?

183
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:31,527
Where'd you hear about those?
Internet. I did some research.

184
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:35,233
Well, those are very rare conditions.
Oh, and anthrax
grows along the interstate?

185
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:37,775
Leishmaniasis doesn't cause
pneumonia, and filariasis--

186
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:40,368
Just look into everything.
This is my son, all right?

187
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:44,610
And I'm gonna stay on top of you
until I know he's safe.
I wouldn't expect anything else.

188
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:51,218
Everyone's a doctor.

189
00:14:56,829 --> 00:15:00,196
Breathe, baby. It's okay.
Breathe. I need you to breathe.

190
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:01,961
His breathing--
It's on the inhale.

191
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,696
What does that mean?
It means his airway's closing up.

192
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,102
Is the anthrax doin' it?

193
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:11,541
All right. Hold still, Gabe.
This is gonna be a little uncomfortable.

194
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:21,311
We've got you. It's okay.

195
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:26,222
- Nodules in his throat.
- Airway's occluded?

196
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:30,319
- We've got to intubate. Ativan!
- Pushing 3 c.c.'s.

197
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:43,463
- Airway's too tight.
- What's wrong? What's wrong?
No, you're killing him!

198
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:46,739
-Jeffrey! Let them do their job.
- Airway's too tight.
Get me a smaller tube.

199
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:48,643
- We're traching.
- Smaller tube.

200
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:56,687
- His lips are cyanotic.
- He's not breathing.

201
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:59,349
Foreman, we're traching.
No. I can do it. I'll get it.

202
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:04,189
- Foreman, you're not getting through.
- He's not getting air.

203
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,788
- We have to trach him right now.
- No, I can do it.

204
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:08,264
Betadine.

205
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:15,431
I'm doing this.

206
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:19,803
Got it.

207
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:33,484
He's okay.

208
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:38,529
Allergic reaction to the antibiotics?

209
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:42,795
I don't think so.
We switched him to rifampin,
and there was no change in the swelling.

210
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:46,702
We should try another antibiotic.
You really think he's allergic
to two antibiotics?

211
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:49,240
I wanna know
what Dr. Chase thinks.

212
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:52,835
It's possible he's allergic--
Oh! I'm sorry. Not you.

213
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:56,369
Understandable mistake.
The other Dr. Chase.

214
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:04,721
Boy gets anthrax
and happens to be allergic
to two antibiotics.

215
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:09,227
Hate to step on anybody's toes,
but is it possible your guys
got this one wrong?

216
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:12,730
The rash is classic anthrax.
Except the color.

217
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,494
The rash hasn't turned black yet.
No necrosis, no anthrax.

218
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:19,059
Necrosis can theoretically take
as long as two weeks.

219
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,204
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

220
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:27,678
Guys, it's not a competition.
It's a diagnosis.

221
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:31,545
Okay. Who thinks Junior wins?

222
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:36,085
Four to one.
It's not anthrax.

223
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:39,852
So we start over.
What's changed?
What do the nodules tell us?

224
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:44,890
- Sarcoidosis.
- Excellent. Send an ACE level.

225
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:49,525
If it comes back positive,
put him on methotrexate.

226
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:54,470
We ran some tests and the results
point toward sarcoidosis.

227
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,236
It makes the body's
tissues swell up.

228
00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:01,143
It seems to have gone after
Gabriel's skin and lungs
and given him this fever.

229
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:03,977
Doctor.

230
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:09,381
We don't know what causes it.

231
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:13,391
But you're sure he has this one?
We have a world-renowned
doctor consulting.

232
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:17,327
- He's convinced this is sarcoidosis.
- Is it treatable?

233
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:23,062
Very, actually.
See, this is I.V. methotrexate.
It's an anti-inflammatory.

234
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:26,161
It should make all the swelling go down
and, uh, get you all better.

235
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:29,332
Stop.

236
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,301
My God, it's black.

237
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:37,147
Necrosis.

238
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:42,347
It's definitely anthrax,
and it definitely can't be anthrax.
It doesn't cause throat nodules.

239
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:47,290
Only explanation is,
this kid's got anthrax and sarcoidosis.

240
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:49,919
Right--
two incredibly rare diseases...

241
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:53,522
-just happening to strike at once.
- Unless you've got a better theory.

242
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,658
Anthrax plus an allergic reaction.

243
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:59,261
Call the Lancet, because that's
one bizarre allergic reaction.

244
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:02,865
Come on. There's no reason
you both can't be wrong.

245
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:05,375
It's not allergy,
but it's not coincidence either.

246
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:07,639
Disease number one set off
disease number two.

247
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:11,615
- Anthrax weakened his immune system.
- And triggered a dormant sarcoidosis.

248
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:16,711
Keep him on antibiotics for the anthrax,
and start the methotrexate
for the sarcoidosis. See what happens.

249
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:18,847
Fine.

250
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:24,892
Better go with him.
Make sure he doesn't snap
and hurt somebody.

251
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,895
Yeah, but y-you're treating him
for both diseases.

252
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:35,133
We're covering all the bases.
What-- throw everything against the wall
and see what sticks?

253
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:37,141
Works for spaghetti.

254
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,229
A-Are you being funny?
Apparently not.

255
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:07,738
You know why I give money
to this hospital?

256
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:10,240
It's the only way
to get attention. See this?

257
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:13,710
Is this a magic trick? 'Cause I am
a total David Copperfield fan.

258
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:18,944
Although I thought that tornado of fire--
that seemed a little fake.
Pain in the wrist. It won't go away for months.

259
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:24,182
Six doctors' brilliant conclusion
is to take it easy.
I write a check, name goes on a plaque,

260
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:28,625
and 48 hours later I've got two M.R.I.'s,
a bone scan and a diagnosis: carpal tunnel.

261
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:31,629
I'm in surgery that afternoon.

262
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:36,259
Fascinating story.
Have you thought
of adapting it for the stage?

263
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:39,771
I love my-- Look at me.
I love my son.

264
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:44,070
I love him more than anything else in
the world. Start paying attention to this case,
or I'm gonna make things miserable--

265
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:46,110
Go to your son's room.
Not until you get your ass--

266
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:48,305
There's a problem.

267
00:20:57,856 --> 00:21:01,622
- What is it?
- I don't know.

268
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,448
Skin lesions are spreading
all over his body.

269
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:30,010
They're opening up,
and the fatty tissues are oozing out.

270
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:34,787
He'll be septic in a matter of days.
Death by dermatitis.

271
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,352
- Where's Robert?
- Uh, he has clinic duty this morning.

272
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:44,391
No, he doesn't.
I rescheduled you guys so you'd be free.
Yeah, but he re-rescheduled himself.

273
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:53,901
It doesn't hurt yet.
Keep going.

274
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,447
You page me?

275
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:58,449
No, I don't need you.
Come on.

276
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:01,315
We all need help now and again.
You're getting a consult.

277
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:07,652
- Okay. We've got new skin lesions,
bigger and uglier. What would cause that?
- My hand hurts.

278
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:12,356
What if his body worked so hard attacking
the anthrax that it started attacking itself?

279
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:14,797
- Autoimmune.
- Wouldn't present this aggressively.

280
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:19,132
- It's not likely, but it is possible.
- What, in a twelve-year-old male?

281
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:24,039
- This isn't about me, is it?
- Gabe's dad found leishmaniasis and filariasis
on the Internet yesterday.

282
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:27,169
- They didn't fit then,
but now they kind of do.
- Sure,

283
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:30,442
except for the nodules, and we're
not working out of Calcutta General.

284
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:33,973
- Multiple neurofibromatosis.
- You think this is neurological?

285
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:37,613
The only reason you're thinking autoimmune
is because you're a rheumatologist.

286
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:40,351
If you were a proctologist,
you'd think rectal cancer.

287
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:42,859
Gotta go with Senior.

288
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:45,988
- He literally wrote the book on this one.
- Autoimmune is a big universe.

289
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:49,033
It could be anything
from scleroderma to Churg-Strauss.

290
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:51,729
Whatever it is,
we should start him on steroids,
keep the swelling down.

291
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:54,533
A hundred milligrams of cytoxan--
it treats most autoimmunes.

292
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:58,064
Well, give it to him now before the fat
starts dripping out his eyeballs.

293
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:03,343
Hey, my fingers are numb.

294
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:05,474
Your watch is on too tight.

295
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:18,689
You're messing with my head.
Your relationship with your dad is
messing with your ability to do your job.

296
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:21,790
Only because you made
my dad part of my job.
Good point.

297
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:25,268
You haven't seen him in years,
he flies across the Atlantic to see you--
Pacific.

298
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:30,331
- You breeze by him like he's a Hare Krishna
at the airport, don't ask why he's in town.
- It's probably a conference.

299
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:33,344
Probably.

300
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:38,281
I was hoping to do this
through sheer manipulation,
but if you insist on talking, fine. Talk.

301
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:44,551
- What did he do to you?
- How would you feel if I interfered
in your personal life?

302
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:48,855
I'd hate it-- that's why
I cleverly have no personal life.

303
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,418
I'm gonna biopsy
his skin lesions.

304
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:56,991
Good thinking. Prove your dad wrong.
That'll solve everything.

305
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:16,112
Who extubated him?
I did.

306
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:19,555
Temperature's down two degrees,
and the swelling's almost gone.

307
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,558
And his skin looks better too.

308
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:24,288
Cytoxan is working.

309
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:27,593
- Feeling better, Gabe?
- Yep, a lot.

310
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:30,863
Dr. Chase, can you and I have a word?

311
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:37,140
Your diagnosis is wrong.
No autoimmune disease.

312
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:41,873
The swelling's probably just down
because we've got him on steroids.
It's masking whatever's really wrong.

313
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:47,613
A.N.A.'s are unreliable.
Phospholipid antibodies are negative,
so no lupus. Same for Churg-Strauss.

314
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:49,620
You're arguing
with a rheumatologist.

315
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:53,715
There's about 20 distinct
autoimmune diseases--
Why are you here?

316
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:58,285
S.L.E. conference.

317
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:02,595
You were in New York last year
for the scleroderma conference.
I didn't hear anything from you.

318
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:06,694
Just wanted to say hi this time.
You said it.
You're still here.

319
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:09,840
I miss you.

320
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:15,505
I was 15 years old
when you walked out.
Now you're walking back in?

321
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:18,515
I left your mother.
I didn't leave you.

322
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:23,680
Mum was living on gin and tonics.
How was I supposed to take care of her?
She wasn't your responsibility.

323
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:26,883
I know! She was yours.

324
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:33,797
I'm sorry she died.
I'm sorry you had to deal with that.

325
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:37,829
But she was falling apart
long before--

326
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:40,804
I've got to talk to House
about this treatment.

327
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:48,340
But the patient's getting better.

328
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:50,347
In spite of the cytoxan.

329
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:54,010
On the other hand-- getting better.

330
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:57,020
Cytoxan makes him more
susceptible to infection.

331
00:25:57,088 --> 00:26:00,353
The anthrax could relapse
and be more resistant.
Better!

332
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:03,758
You want a negative test
for every autoimmune disease
known to man?

333
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:08,765
- Fine. I'll get 'em.
- Be home by midnight
or you can't have the car this weekend.

334
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:13,727
You guys talk?
Did he tell you why he's here?

335
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:17,297
The S.L.E. conference.

336
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:34,016
Going back to the conference?
Afternoon panel.
I hope I can stay awake.

337
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:38,290
I hope you can get in.
You're not registered.

338
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:46,260
I get it. You had to make up a lie.

339
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:49,307
Can't just tell your kid
you're here to see him.

340
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:52,935
I mean, what father does that?

341
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:59,609
That little blue dot under your collar--
it's a tattoo for guiding radiation treatment.

342
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:04,712
I was looking for it after I saw
what you had for breakfast:
brown rice, vegetables.

343
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:10,659
It's a macrobiotic diet--
popular with Hollywood starlets
and... cancer patients.

344
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,989
Lungs. Stage IV.

345
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:20,362
- You look good.
- I'm not.

346
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:25,171
Came to the States
to go to Sloan-Kettering
and see Dr. Wilson.

347
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:29,304
- What'd he say?
- Three months.

348
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:31,349
But you haven't told Robert.

349
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:35,682
You don't want to burden him,
because you were such a lousy dad.

350
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:40,186
I'd prefer you not tell him.

351
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:43,827
Yeah. That's better.

352
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:47,922
I'll get to see his face
when he reads his dad's obituary.

353
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,627
It's not your business.

354
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:55,331
I suppose it isn't.

355
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,241
You sure do a lot of tests.

356
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:11,311
If we figure out exactly
which autoimmune condition it is,
we can get you better quicker.

357
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:15,189
Was that your dad before?
Yeah.

358
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,559
That's so cool.
Do you guys work together a lot?

359
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:21,292
Not really.

360
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,493
When can I go home?

361
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:25,832
We'll see.

362
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:30,170
Looks like you got your appetite back.
That's a good sign.

363
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:32,971
Want some water?
Yes.

364
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:38,239
- Ah!
- Here you go.

365
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:44,180
Whoops.
That's all right. Water's cheap.

366
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:47,588
- Oh, God.
- What?

367
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,223
I can't--
I can't move my hand.

368
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:04,131
Can you squeeze my fingers
for me, Gabe?

369
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:12,876
He's getting worse. Now his entire
right hand and forearm are paralyzed.

370
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:18,116
And his fever's back. It's up over 105.
If we don't stop the nerve deterioration
quickly, he'll be paralyzed for life.

371
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:21,886
Well, luckily, at this rate
that should only last about a week.

372
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,418
- Okay. So--
- I told you we should
get him off the cytoxan.

373
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:30,264
This is toxic neuropathy.
We've been shoving drugs into his system
for a disease he doesn't have.

374
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:35,204
- Well, it could be neurological.
- What kind of brain process
would cause a paralyzed hand,

375
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,798
skin lesions and swollen throat nodules?

376
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:43,109
Robert was right.
You said multiple neurofibromatosis.

377
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:47,550
Are you saying that for the chance
at a beautiful family moment,
or is there some medicine involved?

378
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,883
- Mm-mmm. Fits better.
- Too bad.

379
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:54,050
I was hoping for the other reason.
I was gonna go get my camera.

380
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,958
Get a C.T. scan-- his brain this time.

381
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:07,904
You'd think three copies would
be enough, right?

382
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:11,169
One's always been
more than enough for me.

383
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:14,507
Why didn't you tell me
that Rowan Chase was in to see you?

384
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,946
Excuse me.

385
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:21,577
Ethics, confidentiality--
does any of this ring a bell?

386
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:26,488
You could have covered yourself,
called me in for a consult.
It is a juicy piece of gossip.

387
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:30,892
You know what happened?
I got all focused on his cancer
and lost perspective.

388
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:34,056
You can't tell Chase, but I can.
What should I do?

389
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:38,466
This is where I give you advice
and pretend you're gonna listen to it.
I like this part.

390
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:41,437
Did Rowan ask you not to tell?
I promised I wouldn't.

391
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,531
My fingers were crossed,
though, so I'm wide open.

392
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:48,272
I was wrong. This is the musing-out-loud part.
Do I actually need to be here?
Telling him.

393
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:52,146
Now, that's got real
entertainment value.
Mm. He might even cry.

394
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:54,947
On the other hand, there is
the do-unto-others thingy.

395
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:59,012
Well, then I should definitely tell him.
I'd wanna know.
You wanna know everything.

396
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:01,820
There's also
the keeping-your-promises thingy.

397
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:06,387
Oh, you never run out of thingies--
like that blonde thingy
you were chatting up.

398
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:10,127
She's the hospital accountant.
We were going over billing procedures.

399
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:13,364
Double-entry bookkeeping?

400
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:17,541
What are you gonna do?

401
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:23,338
Billing procedures.
They're so complicated, aren't they?

402
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:44,529
You know, parents are never as bad
as kids think they are.

403
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:48,504
If you like my dad so much,
ask him out.

404
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,508
I'd make an excellent stepmom.
I'm very lenient.

405
00:31:56,414 --> 00:32:00,783
He's your father.
You never see him, and he's here.

406
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:04,344
Unless he's done
some unspeakable thing,
you should lighten up.

407
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,686
Great. Thanks for the tip.

408
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,693
Okay.

409
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:14,459
He beat your mom.
He beat you.

410
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:18,526
What did he do?
Really, don't push it.

411
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:27,041
All this hate. It's toxic.

412
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:30,747
Then stay away.

413
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:41,885
There's nothing there.

414
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:46,420
No masses, no fibrous tangles, nothing.

415
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:48,465
It's not neurofibromatosis.

416
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:52,765
Drs. Chase are 0 for 3.
Even when they agree,
they're wrong.

417
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:57,797
So, next, what else could cause neural damage
as well as all the nodules?
Berger's disease.

418
00:32:57,875 --> 00:33:01,242
- He's never been out of the country.
- Have his parents?
They could have brought it back.

419
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:05,578
- I don't think so.
- It doesn't matter. His lesions are in the
wrong place. His feet are the one clear spot.

420
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:09,177
- Kid's dad mentioned leishmaniasis.
- Yeah, and filariasis.

421
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:14,520
- But the throat nodules still don't fit with that.
- That's two diseases pretty much
exclusive to Southeast Asia.

422
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:22,965
What if the anthrax
didn't set off the second disease?

423
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:28,028
- We're back at coincidence again?
- No. What if something else
was the trigger?

424
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:30,040
- Nothing else happened.
- We happened.

425
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:33,544
- Antibiotics?
- We've been through this.
It's not an allergy.

426
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:37,204
I gotta pee.

427
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:55,627
- What did the C.T. scan tell you?
- Nothing.

428
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,669
Ow!
Scale from one to 10--
how painful?

429
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:02,638
Not half as painful
as when I punch you in the face.
Don't do that. It'll hurt you.

430
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:06,370
- Carpal tunnel surgery
obviously didn't work.
- Who are you?

431
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:11,541
The little ones call me Uncle Greg.
Your dad never had carpal tunnel.

432
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:15,712
You mentioned
two obscure diseases to Dr. Chase.
How did you know about them?

433
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:20,918
- I read about them on the Internet.
- What did you search for-- "Diseases from Asia
that don't match my son's symptoms"?

434
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:23,222
- You head about them in Asia.
- I've never been there.

435
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:26,388
Well, you probably just forgot.
Let me refresh your memory:

436
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:30,867
some remote, dusty village,
close quarters, at least a year?

437
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:33,096
- Starting to come back?
- I'm calling Dr. Cuddy.

438
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:35,765
Excuse me, what does this
have to do with our son?

439
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:39,071
Your dad's pissed off. He should be.

440
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:44,103
Comes here expecting us to do
an extra-good job because he gives
a whole lot of money to this hospital.

441
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:47,345
- Don't talk to my son like that!
-Just telling him my job and my obligation--

442
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:51,184
Stop!
What's going on?

443
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:58,060
There's only one thing
you guys have gotta do.

444
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:03,964
Tell the truth, or your son will die.

445
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:08,729
How long were you in Asia?

446
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:14,038
Jeff, it's a simple question.

447
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:21,108
Two years, in India.

448
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:25,784
Why would you lie
about something like that?
It was '87 and '88.

449
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:34,829
This, uh--

450
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:38,562
This guru--
I-I thought he had some answers.

451
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:43,403
I went to his ashram...

452
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:48,275
and, um, ended up with no money
and no answers.

453
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:52,849
I was embarrassed.
I didn't want anyone to know.

454
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:56,186
No.

455
00:35:58,055 --> 00:36:00,683
No. You were a test pilot.

456
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:03,522
I'm so sorry, Gabe.

457
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:08,027
What does this have to do with my son?

458
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:19,566
Clue number one: If I were Jesus,
curing this kid would be as easy
as turning water into wine.

459
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:23,341
Demonic possession?
Close, but no wafer.

460
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:29,353
Clue number two:
Rheumatology Rowan was almost right.
It causes autoimmune symptoms.

461
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:32,856
- Leprosy?
- Yeah, that's real big
in the Jersey suburbs.

462
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:37,452
It's leprosy.
Run a Fite stain. It'll be positive.

463
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:40,895
Daddy hung out on
the wrong kind of Indian ashram.

464
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:43,991
But it's obviously dormant in the dad.
How could the kid catch it?

465
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:46,502
It's not dormant in the dad.
It's just slow.

466
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:50,132
Damaged his ulnar nerves.
Was misdiagnosed as carpal tunnel.

467
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:54,167
Never trust doctors.
Run a Fite stain.

468
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:58,306
No wonder he got anthrax.
The leprosy weakened his immune system.

469
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:01,909
Vicious circle: The leprosy
made him vulnerable
to the anthrax,

470
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:04,352
and the anthrax treatment
put the leprosy in overdrive.

471
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:10,122
- But the antibiotics we gave him--
they cure leprosy.
- Yeah. That's where the trouble starts.

472
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:12,890
The antibiotics hit the nerve strands.

473
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:16,661
They kill the leprosy bacteria,
and the corpses get tossed into the system.

474
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:19,999
And as fascinating as our bodies are,
they're also stupid.

475
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:24,167
They produce antibodies
to beat dead bacteria.

476
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,836
And these aren't the polite antibodies.

477
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,937
They're the ones that won't sit still,
kick during nap time.

478
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:32,380
They attack his neural and fat cells,

479
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:35,942
causing inflammation
and all the rest of his symptoms.

480
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,284
So the cure's killing him.

481
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:43,225
I want you to call down to Carville, Louisiana,
home of the last leper colony in the Lower 48.

482
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:45,421
Get 'em to send up
some thalidomide.

483
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:48,932
- Thalidomide?
- Twelve-year-olds don't have sex, right?
So he can't be pregnant.

484
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,991
Make the call.

485
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:57,100
I need to speak to your boy.

486
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:00,367
Hmm.

487
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:12,979
Why does everybody
need to know my business?

488
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:15,787
People like talking about people.

489
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:19,694
Makes us feel superior,
makes us feel in control,

490
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:24,428
and sometimes, for some people,
knowing some things makes them care.

491
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:29,667
I tell you my dad left,
my mum drank herself to death,
you gonna care about me more?

492
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:33,608
Cameron would.
Me, I just like knowing stuff.

493
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:38,644
I know you hate your dad.

494
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:40,980
- Now, I'm gonna tell you something--
- I don't hate him.

495
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:47,289
I loved him until I figured out
that it hurts a lot less to just not care.

496
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:52,193
You don't expect him to turn up
to your football match,
no disappointments.

497
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:58,224
You don't expect a call on your birthday,
don't expect to see him for months,
no disappointments.

498
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:04,941
You want us to go make up--
sink a few beers together, nice family hug?

499
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:13,449
I've given him enough hugs.
He's given me enough disappointments.

500
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:20,187
Okay.

501
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:25,994
- That's it?
- That's it.

502
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:52,885
Breathe.

503
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:57,852
Breathe again.

504
00:39:57,928 --> 00:39:59,919
Breathe again.

505
00:39:59,997 --> 00:40:03,933
Are you gonna have
to tell my friends I'm a leper?

506
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:07,402
You had the antibiotics.
You're not contagious anymore.

507
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:10,497
Well, what if they already caught it?

508
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:15,671
Leprosy is incredibly hard to catch.
Even your mum didn't get it.

509
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:19,443
Right. I want you to make a fist.

510
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:21,542
It's still kinda stiff.

511
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:25,919
It'll get back to normal
in a month or two.
Your skin, two or three weeks.

512
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:28,515
Security 12, call 3662.

513
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:31,755
You haven't asked about your dad.

514
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:35,788
He lied about everything.

515
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:40,235
He lied to my mom.
He lied to his boss.

516
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:42,295
He's just a liar.

517
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:45,742
He loves you.

518
00:40:47,878 --> 00:40:50,438
I don't love him.

519
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:54,110
Yeah, you do.

520
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:03,451
Nothing you can do about it.
He's your dad.

521
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:06,985
It doesn't matter what he does.
You're gonna love him.

522
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:22,535
Here. Thanks.

523
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:25,939
Hey!

524
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:39,195
When's your flight?
You got time for a drink?

525
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:42,289
Wish I did.

526
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:45,301
Dr. Chase?

527
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:56,469
I got it.

528
00:41:59,216 --> 00:42:02,549
You're gonna be gettin' down
to Oz anytime soon?

529
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:07,213
Not too long.
Next autumn, I hope.

530
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:11,227
I'll call ya.

531
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:15,959
Well, you're all set.

532
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:28,007
I'll see ya.
Yeah.

533
00:42:28,078 --> 00:42:30,012
I'll see you.

534
