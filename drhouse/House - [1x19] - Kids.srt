1
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:37,995
Visualizing?

2
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:41,438
All right.
You're up, tiger.

3
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:44,602
You feel all right?
You look a little pale.

4
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:47,578
I'm fine.
Does your neck still hurt?

5
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:51,378
It'll be fine.
Maybe you should
do the two-and-a-half instead.

6
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:54,284
I'm gonna do the three.
Well, it's better to nail
the two-and-a-half than--

7
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:57,790
I'm gonna nail the three.

8
00:00:57,857 --> 00:00:59,791
All right.

9
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:04,421
Well, let's show these senior citizens
what a well-coached
12-year-old can do, huh?

10
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:25,246
Next diver, two-time National
Junior champion, Mary Carroll.

11
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:47,806
Damn it.

12
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:52,334
You can do this.
Come on, just... see it. See it.

13
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:09,560
Big jump. Pike out. Rip it.

14
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:37,986
Call 911.
We need an ambulance.

15
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:47,317
- I saw the light on.
- It's daytime.

16
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,418
It's a figure of speech.

17
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:51,486
Always so literal.

18
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:58,567
- Got a new cane.
- Yeah.

19
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:01,004
Guy in the store
said it was slimming.

20
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,770
Vertical stripe.

21
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:06,903
- Why are you here?
- Vogler is dead.

22
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,880
What? What happened?

23
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:12,941
Again with the literal translation.
Vogler, the idea.

24
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,954
Mr. Destructo, Mr. Moneybags.
"Bow down before me".

25
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:17,956
He is gone from the hospital.

26
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:19,924
So things can go back
to the way they were.

27
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:22,257
The way they were
was kind of weird.

28
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:25,957
Hmm. Weird works for me.

29
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:29,263
What are you saying?
Literally.

30
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:33,271
- I want you to come back.
- Why?

31
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:41,406
Please unclench.

32
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:44,882
You're not on the clock,
and when you do that,
I clench and it's a whole thing.

33
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,249
Could you look at your pager?

34
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:56,792
It's no big deal.
Some sort of epidemic.
Not my area.

35
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:59,661
- You should go. It's important.
- What I'm doing now is important.

36
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:03,930
- Why do you want me back?
- 'Cause you're a good doctor.

37
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,798
- That's it?
- That's not enough?

38
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,677
Not for me.

39
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:18,483
Go deal with your plague.

40
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:29,660
You are in a quarantined area.

41
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:34,291
Please remain calm and stay in line.
A doctor will see you shortly.

42
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:38,804
When you see a doctor,
you will receive a blue or yellow form.

43
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:42,773
Patients with blue forms
must immediately exit
to the parking lot.

44
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,333
Dr. House. Need you here.

45
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:49,279
Sorry. Lot of sick people.
I might catch something.

46
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,283
A judge at the campus pool center
collapsed.

47
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,683
L.P. revealed a virulent form
of bacterial meningitis.

48
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:56,244
Great. You got it diagnosed.
You don't need me.

49
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:59,985
2,500 people at the pool center
were exposed.

50
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:01,993
They're being bused
to all the neighboring hospitals.

51
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:04,256
That's a problem with resources,
not diagnostics.

52
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,924
I-- I'd be completely lost,
get in everyone's way.

53
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:10,230
Joe. Dr. House doesn't have
a blue slip.

54
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:13,170
No one leaves the quarantine area
without a blue slip.

55
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:16,140
You are a doctor at this hospital.
Act like one.

56
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,143
And...

57
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,338
take these.

58
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:31,546
102.

59
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:34,115
You win a trip
to the second floor.

60
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:36,184
Next.

61
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:43,532
All right.
No fever. No rash.

62
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:47,061
You're fine.
Take these two pills.

63
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,405
And show this blue slip
to Security on your way out.

64
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:52,034
Next.

65
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:53,942
Take these. Go home.

66
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:56,709
Talk to your daughter.
What?

67
00:06:56,783 --> 00:07:02,278
Your pants, your blouse, your scarf
are all freshly dry cleaned.
Everything except your jacket.

68
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:05,518
It's got a smudge on it.
Probably two days old.

69
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,525
Which means you didn't know
the jacket had been worn.

70
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,562
So either your husband is a cross-dresser,

71
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,758
or your daughter's been
borrowing your clothes
without telling you.

72
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,063
She probably wants to look older
to get into bars.

73
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:19,127
I don't have a daughter.

74
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:26,539
Next.

75
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,274
So I have it?
Take the yellow form
to the second floor.

76
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:31,282
You're gonna be fine.
I'm gonna die.

77
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,945
It's treatable--
as long as you go to the second floor.

78
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:36,955
Next.

79
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:41,386
Yow.

80
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,588
Fever?
Does that mean I have it?

81
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:46,131
Do you have a rash?

82
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,167
Come on.

83
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,762
It's from my new bathing suit.
I've had it a week.

84
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,897
Yeah.

85
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,806
Does your neck hurt?
If it does, you hit the trifecta.

86
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:59,572
It's nothing.
I pulled it trying to do
a three-and-a-half tuck.

87
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:02,671
Where are your parents?
We live in Chicago.

88
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:04,943
I'm here with my coach.

89
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:12,083
I wanted to see
what you were writing.

90
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,018
Go like this.

91
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:18,963
Ow.

92
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,462
Go like this.

93
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,441
Take these pills.

94
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,740
Blue slip will
get you out of here.

95
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,944
Next.

96
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,382
You're coming with me.

97
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:43,183
Proceed to the second floor
for further examination.

98
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,724
You're gonna need a C.T. scan.
Second floor.

99
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,725
Take the elevators,
follow the parade.

100
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:49,954
Next.

101
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:57,999
Maybe it's something systemic.
Or maybe it's meningitis.

102
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,233
She's had the rash a week.
If it was this meningitis
she'd be dead by now.

103
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:03,241
You guys figure
we're done down there?

104
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:06,073
The 800 people milling around
are just waiting for the bathroom?

105
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:09,876
Twelve-year-old female.
Fever, rash, neck pains.
Not meningitis.

106
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,883
It's the definition
of meningitis.

107
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:15,250
Sure. Pus in the spinal canal
makes it hurt to move your head
up and down,

108
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:17,152
but her neck only hurts
moving side to side.

109
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,418
- Oh, side to side.
- Doesn't fit.

110
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:22,086
The three of you, lobby, now.

111
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:24,254
Those little pills you're passing out
so efficiently...

112
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,389
aren't gonna do
Miss Louganis squat.

113
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:28,433
You just don't want to deal
with the epidemic.

114
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,435
That's right.
I'm subjecting a 12-year-old...

115
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:33,870
to a battery of dangerous
and invasive tests
to avoid being bored.

116
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:38,608
Okay, maybe I would do that.
But I'm not.

117
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,839
If it turns out
she's got meningitis,

118
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,643
you're right, you win;
but if we go back downstairs
and she dies--

119
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:46,514
your face will be so red.

120
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:49,921
You have one hour.

121
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:55,750
Get a lumbar puncture.
Some brain infections can be
pretty clever at hide-and-seek.

122
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:58,422
I'll get on her blood work.
No, you won't.

123
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:01,796
You, sir, will research all the causes
in the universe of neck pain.

124
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:05,530
- The list is, like, two miles long.
- Start with the letter "A".

125
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,631
And put her on rifampin.
Rifampin is for meningitis.
You just said--

#https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifampicin

126
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,642
In case I'm wrong.

127
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,473
It has happened.

128
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,988
Brenda, I need a C.B.C. Chem 7
in 2046.

129
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:34,226
Hold on.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

130
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,427
Hey, there's a line here.
That's why I said excuse me.

131
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:38,834
Brenda, I need a bed and a--
We all need stuff.

132
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:40,929
Push me again.

133
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:42,838
Brenda, I need a bed and a nurse
for a lumbar puncture.

134
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:45,604
No beds, no nurses for at least four hours.
I've only got one.

135
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:48,112
Your patient only has an hour to live
unless she gets a lumbar puncture?

136
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,581
Cuddy only gave us an hour
to work on the patient.

137
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,449
Back of the line.

138
00:10:57,423 --> 00:11:01,519
Do not leave the quarantine area
until you have been seen by a doctor.

139
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:05,291
When you see a doctor,
you will receive a blue or yellow form--

140
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:08,765
This novocaine will numb you
for the lumbar puncture.

141
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,667
Sorry this has to be
so public, Mary.

142
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:15,036
Normally I'm in a bathing suit
with 5,000 people staring at my butt.

143
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:17,041
I can block this out.

144
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:22,674
These kids are all very mature.
Travel around the country
from event to event.

145
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,316
Okay, I want you to hold your knees
and tuck your head.

146
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:29,616
- Like a dive?
- Exactly.

147
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:35,819
Good. Great.
Don't forget to breathe.

148
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,994
All right.

149
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:42,034
Sorry.

150
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:45,266
Geez. Coach, help me out here.

151
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:47,328
Play a little defense
before I poke the wrong thing.

152
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:54,905
Okay, here we go.

153
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:02,482
- Ow. I feel it. Ow. I feel it. I fee-- Ow.
- Try to relax, Mary. Try to relax.

154
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,420
Relax.

155
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:16,532
What letter are you up to?
"A".

156
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:19,594
Torture combing through
all that stuff, ain't it?

157
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:23,540
- Real dull. Awful.
- It's no problem.

158
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:25,133
Well, thank goodness.

159
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:28,874
A lot of people would resent
having to do this.

160
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:38,623
If you receive a blue form,
please exit the area.

161
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:42,092
If you receive a yellow form,
please proceed to the second floor.

162
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,095
Where's the 12-year-old girl
that was here?

163
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:46,927
Needed the gurney.
She just had a lumbar puncture.

164
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:49,695
She's not supposed to be moved.
Sorry. We needed the gurney.

165
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:00,441
Hey.

166
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:03,038
- Hey.
- You okay? How's your head feeling?

167
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,276
She's got a headache
and she's dizzy.

168
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:07,911
She shouldn't have been moved
after the procedure.
I'm sorry.

169
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:12,085
I'm fine.
What did the test show?

170
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:14,217
No meningitis and no other infections.

171
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:18,889
But you're not carrying a blue form.
I have something else, don't I?

172
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:22,400
Something's causing your symptoms.
We're gonna keep you here
overnight.

173
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:25,665
I know it's a little crazy in here,
but hopefully it'll settle down...

174
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:28,536
and we'll be able
to get you a room.

175
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:35,238
I'm sorry.
I'm not usually all emotional like this.
I just--

176
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:40,111
You're doing great.
Your folks land in a few hours.

177
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:42,279
I just-- I haven't slept.
I'm so tired.

178
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:47,082
Oh, my God. My eye's bleeding.

179
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,753
What is it?
What's happening?

180
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:56,094
Oh, don't worry.

181
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:59,660
The antibiotic we gave you
in case you had meningitis
can turn your tears reddish.

182
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,603
That's not blood.

183
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:13,816
But that--

184
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:15,820
That's blood.

185
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,621
That's going into my stomach?

186
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,961
The lavage showed blood
in your G.I. tract.

187
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,091
We need to find
where it's coming from.

188
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,102
You won't feel it.

189
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:35,038
I'm gonna numb the back of your throat,
and Dr. Foreman is gonna
give you a sedative. Open.

190
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:38,770
- Ugh.
- Swallow.

191
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:40,835
Now lay on your side for me.

192
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:46,546
And... here we go.

193
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:53,623
- Yell fire or something.
- People, this area is highly contagious.

194
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:56,889
Please step back. Highly contagious.

195
00:14:56,962 --> 00:15:02,127
All right. Try to relax, Mary.
This shouldn't take too long.

196
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:05,693
I don't see any tears or lesions.

197
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,976
All right. I'm in the stomach.

198
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:14,205
It's not bleeding.

199
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,249
There was more than a tablespoon
of blood in the mouth,
so it's gotta be there.

200
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:19,477
Maybe her small intestine.

201
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,884
Thirty feet of digestive tract,
it could be anywhere in there.

202
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:26,356
We're not gonna see it with this.

203
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:32,320
Believe it or not, this is a camera.

204
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:36,528
You swallow it,
and it goes all the way
through your system.

205
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:41,169
The antennae pick up the signal
from the pill.

206
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,708
Then we look at the video
of your intestines,

207
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,540
see where the blood is coming from,
and fix it.

208
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,706
All right? Water?

209
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,716
Down the hatch.

210
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:06,561
Think I've seen this movie.

211
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,533
The ending's kind of dark.

212
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:11,535
You want one?

213
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:15,432
How come you did the endoscopy?

214
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:17,771
- He asked for help.
- Her blood pressure was high.

215
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:20,038
Foreman is not your boss.

216
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:22,376
When I tell you to do something--

217
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:24,382
Whoa. Hold it there.

218
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,317
Back it up a couple of frames.

219
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:32,089
Oh, yeah.
That's your money shot.

220
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,091
I don't see anything.

221
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:38,596
Really? "Ginormous" thing
on the right side of her intestine.
That doesn't intrigue you?

222
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,928
Does "ginormous" mean really big,
or really, really small?

223
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,800
- 'Cause I don't see anything.
- There? The Dieulafoy?

224
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,804
Well, we can burn off
the swollen blood vessel,

225
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:50,069
but it still doesn't account
for her other symptoms.

226
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:52,167
No, but it does tell us something.

227
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:54,269
Though I have no idea what.

228
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:57,440
Could be a precursor
to intestinal intussusception.

229
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:01,782
Precursor isn't causing
all her other symptoms.
What else?

230
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:05,017
You, in the lobby now.

231
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:09,356
I hurt my leg. I have a note.
You had your hour--
three, actually.

232
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:12,761
Dr. Chase, I told you to tell us
when our time was up.

233
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:17,267
She has intestinal bleeding.
She'll wait.

234
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:19,998
Two more buses just arrived.
We need you downstairs.

235
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:24,031
No, you need more nurses,
but you cut back
on the nursing staff,

236
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:26,475
so now you've got doctors doing
what nurses should be doing.

237
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,479
That's true.

238
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:33,382
I wonder if that has anything to do
with you costing us $100 million.

239
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:41,055
Attention. If you do not have a blue form,

240
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:44,892
you will not be allowed
to leave the quarantine area.

241
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:46,897
Go. Be free.

242
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:48,830
If it's not the intussusception,
what about stomach cancer?

243
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:51,869
Does she have any abdominal pain?
No.

244
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:54,235
Then it's not stomach cancer.
Have you ruled out sepsis?

245
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:58,572
The L.P. and blood smears
showed no signs of infection.
Here. Take these two pills and you can go.

246
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:01,579
Well, the lab's working
at double their capacity.
Maybe someone screwed up.

247
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:04,673
No fever, no neck pain.

248
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,241
Take the elevator to the third floor--
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wrong form.

249
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:12,313
- No fever, no neck pain. She's fine.
- Smell her hair. No chlorine.

250
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:15,883
Which means she wasn't at the pool,
which means she's come
to a quarantined area...

251
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:18,896
because she's an idiot or she's insane.

252
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:23,094
No one is that stupid.
East wing, psych ward. Bye-bye.

253
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:27,371
Neck pain could be a symptom
for bone cancer.

254
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,408
You up to the B's? Well done.

255
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:33,934
That would account for all her
meningeal symptoms-- rash, fever.

256
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:35,673
You're fine.
Take these two pills.

257
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:37,772
Get a sample of her bone marrow.

258
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,909
From here?
Break time.

259
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:43,352
- I need more than 15 minutes.
- Use Chase's break too.

260
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:47,917
Go.

261
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:53,228
You should just fire Chase.
What, and miss out
on all this fun?

262
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,562
So you're gonna
torture him for a while
and then fire him?

263
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,068
That's cold.
You don't think he has it coming?

264
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,402
Hey, I said fire him.
That's cold.

265
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,600
All he did was save his job.
What?

266
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:06,075
He completely screwed you over.

267
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,740
Right rudder.

268
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,612
Bank, bank, bank.

269
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:16,052
Good coffee?
The rest of this hospital
is busting its tail and you're--

270
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:20,285
- What are you doing?
- Trying to think of anything except
the produce department at Whole Foods.

271
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:26,491
I am working. It got hot.
Stop acting like a 13-year-old.
Sorry.

272
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:29,432
You just don't usually see breasts like that
on deans of medicine.

273
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,163
Oh, women can't be
heads of hospitals?
Or just ugly ones?

274
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:36,469
No, they can be babes.
It's just you don't usually see their fun bags.

275
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:41,578
Your 3:00 interview
for Dr. Cameron's position
is in your office.

276
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:45,981
Not interviewing today.
I don't know if you've heard,
but there's this big-time epidemic.

277
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:50,647
Many sick people.
Puking in the hallways. It's crazy.
We can reschedule.

278
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:53,520
No, you won't.
You will interview this person.

279
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:56,755
And if he can put
two sentences together,
you will send him to the lobby...

280
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:58,762
where he will do his job.

281
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,821
Unlike the two of you.

282
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:07,430
Come on. You know I can't do
a bone marrow aspiration
in the hallway.

283
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:09,440
And I can't give you
a procedure room.

284
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:11,806
I just need something at least
close to a sterile environment.

285
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,004
I need ten more nurses.

286
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:16,639
Brenda, listen. Listen.
She'll die.

287
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:20,549
At least she'll have a bed then.
Put that over there.

288
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,494
Are there dead people
in those cabinets?

289
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,830
I hope that's who's in there.

290
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:49,340
Just be calm. Relax.

291
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:57,784
Ow. Ow, ow, ow, ow.

292
00:20:57,856 --> 00:21:00,222
Hang on.

293
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:04,023
Hang on.

294
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:13,896
You know, I really admire the way
you don't care what anyone thinks.
You just do what you want, the way you want.

295
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:18,175
So you went to Hopkins
for both undergrad
and med school?

296
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:21,838
- That's right.
- He's in a band.

297
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:26,678
- You're into music?
- Totally.

298
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:28,720
What kind of music do you play?

299
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:32,553
Mostly blues, you know,
James Cotton,
some original stuff.

300
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:36,856
- Oh, dude, you are so hired.
- Really?

301
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:40,921
- Not a chance.
- Why?

302
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:43,593
Tattoo.

303
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:48,939
Wow. I thought you'd be the last person
to have a problem with nonconformity.

304
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:51,271
Nonconformity. Right.

305
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:55,109
I can't remember the last time
I saw a 20-something kid with a tattoo
of an Asian letter on his wrist.

306
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,148
You are one wicked freethinker.

307
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:59,445
You want to be a rebel?
Stop being cool.

308
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:02,578
Wear a pocket protector like he does,
and get a haircut,

309
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:05,521
like the Asian kids who don't leave
the library for 20-hour stretches.

310
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,581
They're the ones who don't care
what you think.

311
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,652
Sayonara.

312
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,965
So, should I go through all the résumés
looking for Asian names?

313
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:25,738
Actually, the Asian kids are probably
just responding to parental pressure,
but my point is still valid.

314
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:30,342
So when do they think
you're getting out of here?

315
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:32,349
They don't know.

316
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:35,147
You don't look sick.
Better hope you're not.

317
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,587
- This equipment looks
like it's 100 years old.
-Just got it out of storage.

318
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:41,990
It is the previous generation,
but it works just fine.

319
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,994
Could you, uh--
Could you guys give us a second?

320
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:47,689
If it's good news, you can tell them.

321
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:51,964
Okay. We're, uh, we're pretty sure
it's not cancer.

322
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,267
- Hey, that's great.
- I'll call your parents.

323
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:57,968
Well, we still can't release her.
We still don't know yet exactly
what's causing the--

324
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:04,715
Mary?

325
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:08,719
- What's wrong?
- She's having an absence seizure.
Mary? You okay?

326
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:13,554
She looks fine.
I need some help over here.
Push two milligrams Ativan, stat.

327
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:35,205
Are you sure it was
an absence seizure?

328
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,373
Absolutely.
She was totally unresponsive...

329
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:40,043
and unaware of what was
going on around her.

330
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,189
Do you mind?
We're trying to work.

331
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,555
We should get back out there.
Cuddy's gonna be looking for us.

332
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:50,186
Looking, but not finding.
Did you do an E.E.G.?

333
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:53,925
Seizure frequency's increasing.
They-- They're almost constant now.
Five in the last half hour.

334
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:55,864
Which tells us--
It's definitely in her brain.

335
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,402
- And it's getting worse.
- And?

336
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:03,301
Good Lord.
Are you having a bowl movement
or a baby?

337
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:06,833
Could be barbiturate withdrawal.
- No, it can't be drugs.

338
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:10,712
She's tested at every meet she competes at.
A bleed in the brain
could cause seizures.

339
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,909
Rat poison?
Could also cause the neck pain.

340
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:15,452
You think she's eating off the floor
of her folks' garage?

341
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,454
Doesn't have to be.

342
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:19,820
Who would poison a 12-year-old?

343
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:24,521
Well, let's see now.
There's the 18-year-old has-been that she
beat out to make the Nationals,

344
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:28,532
the has-been's parents, jealous siblings,
sociopathic swim fan,

345
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,297
and then there's just your plain old
garden variety whack job.

346
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:40,241
Hey.

347
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:44,510
- You know what a hemorrhoid is?
- No.

348
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:48,747
Well, Google it.
And try some raisin bran
instead of the doughnuts.

349
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,421
Do a C.T. scan.
Check for intracranial bleeding.

350
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:57,053
Not a chance.
Radiology's totally swamped.

351
00:24:57,128 --> 00:25:00,097
If our patient's bleeding into her brain,
she's gonna be dead in eight hours.

352
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:03,464
She could be, but a meningitis patient
will be without a C.T. scan.

353
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:09,031
- When I was in med school,
I had this old professor--
- Who touched you in the naughty place?

354
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:15,042
Before the C.T. scan was introduced,
he specialized in transcranial ultrasound.

355
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:17,047
Hmm.

356
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:19,913
Ancient, but if there's
enough bleeding it might work.

357
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:23,716
Okay, do what the guy
who didn't specialize
in neurology said.

358
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:26,256
It was my idea.

359
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:29,452
Nyah, nyah, nyah.
You've still gotta cover "Q" to "Z".

360
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:42,732
Sorry I'm late.
I was taking a dump.

361
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:47,107
I'm guessing I'm better off
interviewing right after
than right before.

362
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,572
Dr. Petra Gilmar, Dr. Gregory House.

363
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:56,417
You actually speak four languages,
or are you just banking on never
being interviewed by anyone who does?

364
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:59,355
It's true, and I can swear
in two more.

365
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:02,359
Why are you leaving Dr. Hazel?

366
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:06,363
Did you fall for him and can't handle it,
or was it the other way around?

367
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:09,798
- Yes, well, pretty much
every fellowship ends that way.
- No, it was nothing like that.

368
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:11,927
- You Jewish?
- Yes.

369
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:14,494
Is it true what they say about jewish foreplay?

370
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,200
- Two hours of begging?
- I heard four.

371
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:18,333
Well, actually, I'm only half Jewish.

372
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,205
Look, I know you like
to play games with people.

373
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:27,274
I know you like
to say outrageous things
and study how they react.

374
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:30,150
What you should know about me
is that I grew up with four brothers.

375
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:33,952
Keep your hands to yourself,
I'm okay with anything
that comes out of your mouth.

376
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:39,554
Uh, well, that's, uh, great.
I think that's all we need.

377
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:42,862
Thank you for coming by.
Thank you.

378
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:59,647
- That's our Hitler!
- No way.

379
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:02,710
Are you kidding?
Her background's perfect.

380
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,687
She's smart, she can obviously deal
with your insanity--

381
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:06,747
You see her shoes?
Her shoes?

382
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:09,817
What, did your horoscope in Vogue
tell you to avoid women wearing green shoes?

383
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:12,419
The eyes can mislead,
a smile can lie,

384
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:14,761
but the shoes always tell the truth.

385
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:18,098
- They were Prada.
Means she has good taste.
- They were not Prada.

386
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:20,694
You wouldn't know Prada
if one stepped on your scrotum.

387
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:24,401
Okay. Well, they were nice. Pointy.
Exactly.

388
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,036
They were stylish,
and very painful to wear.

389
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:29,103
Only an incredibly shallow,
insecure woman...

390
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:32,616
would rather be in pain all day long
than wear a decent-looking,
comfortable shoe,

391
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:34,618
and that's exactly the type
I don't need around here.

392
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:36,620
No. Someone
who can handle a lot of pain...

393
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:39,680
is exactly the type you do need.

394
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:57,605
Excuse me.

395
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:54,962
What are you doing?

396
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:57,399
I'm "ultrasounding" your head.

397
00:28:57,469 --> 00:29:01,462
You're still having seizures.
This should help us
figure out what's going on.

398
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:08,969
Blue form to the security guard.
You're not gonna be happy
with anyone.

399
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:11,413
So what, your advice is...

400
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:14,281
hire someone I'm not happy with
and be happy?

401
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:16,320
No, my advice is much more subtle.
Stop being an ass.

402
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:20,016
You always find some tiny little flaw
to push people away.

403
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,958
Oh, now it's people.
I thought we were talking
about fellowship applicants.

404
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:25,655
You have a history of this.
Well, when I do decide...

405
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:29,689
to push you away, I hope there's
a small person kneeling behind you,
so you fall down and hurt your head.

406
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,669
Take these.
There's water over there.
Blue form to the guard.

407
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:34,671
And you're done.

408
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:38,835
You had the perfect person,
and you blew it.

409
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,844
You saw the shoes.

410
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:44,279
I'm not talking about her.
You're talking about Cameron.

411
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:46,783
I'm talking about every woman
you've ever given a damn about.

412
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:48,819
Cameron is so not perfect.

413
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:50,821
Well, nobody's perfect.

414
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:52,823
Mother Teresa?
Dead.

415
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:54,722
Angelina Jolie?

416
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,489
No medical degree.
Now who's being picky?

417
00:29:57,562 --> 00:30:00,122
You're gonna wind up alone,
House.

418
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:02,564
You were right.
There's a significant bleed
in her temporal lobe.

419
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,568
But no poisons.

420
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:07,935
Did tox screens on
her blood, urine, and hair.
Nothing. Did them twice.

421
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:10,839
He's a little dehydrated.
Put him on a saline drip
and give him some orange juice.

422
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:14,436
I need an operating room
and a neurosurgeon.

423
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:16,412
Given the current crisis,
I'm tempted to say no,

424
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,472
but since you've been
so sweet to me today--

425
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,041
Our little mermaid is bleeding
into her temporal lobe.

426
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:25,021
- How fast can you have her prepped?
- Twenty minutes.

427
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:27,785
You'll have a surgeon in the room in ten.

428
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:48,606
Mr. and Mrs. Carroll?
Are you Dr. House?

429
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,308
- This is Dr. Foreman.
- Is Mary all right?

430
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:53,316
The operation went well.

431
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:56,547
The intracranial pressure's been relieved,
and the swelling's already
going down.

432
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:58,953
Oh, thank God.
Well, what happened?

433
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,389
I mean, did she bang her head
at a meet, or did she--

434
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:06,260
- No, nothing like that.
- Then why is she bleeding?
Is she gonna be all right?

435
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,557
I'm sorry.
We still don't know.

436
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:34,989
No toxins, no tumor, no bone cancer.

437
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:37,619
Renal failure could cause the rash,
fever, and muscle pain.

438
00:31:37,695 --> 00:31:40,391
Maybe it's some sort
of genetic kidney disorder.
No family history.

439
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:43,628
- And no blood in her urine or uremia.
- Not yet.

440
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:46,795
You want to do a differential based
on symptoms that might happen?

441
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:48,839
- You got a better idea?
- Stop it.

442
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:53,602
Stop looking for things we don't know
and focus on what we do know.

443
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:56,579
What do we actually know,
besides what's up there?

444
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:02,518
Come on.
How hard can it be
to tell me what you already know?

445
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:06,523
- She's 12.
-She spends a lot of time in pools--
exposure to chemicals.

446
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,525
- She travels a lot.
- But never out of the country.

447
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:11,585
What else?

448
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:14,063
Come on!

449
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,882
We're gonna put you
right here.

450
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:36,882
We're missing something.

451
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,583
What?
Well, if I knew that,
it wouldn't be missing.

452
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:44,386
Maybe she's adopted
and we've got the wrong history.

453
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:47,761
No. She's got her mom's eyes
and a red patch of hair just like Dad.

454
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:50,096
What about an allergic reaction?

455
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:53,934
That could explain the rash and muscle pain,
but probably not the bleeding or seizures.

456
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:57,304
That's a lot of balloons.

457
00:32:57,375 --> 00:33:02,244
- You think she's allergic to polyester?
- Not unless she's been competing
in the nude all these years.

458
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:06,545
Then what are you thinking?
What do the balloons mean?

459
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:14,056
What if the rash isn't a rash?

460
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:16,059
What are you talking about?

461
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:19,460
Who gave her the balloons?
Some of the girls
from her team.

462
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:22,988
They've been visiting her pretty regularly,
but none of them are sick.
What about the guys?

463
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:25,627
- None of them are sick either.
- Which guys visited her?

464
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:27,637
Uh--

465
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:29,764
Actually, none.

466
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:35,410
She's cute. She's nice.

467
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,971
She's a kick-ass diver.

468
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:41,644
You'd think the guys would be
falling all over themselves
to get close to her.

469
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:44,654
She's 12.
The youngest guy
on her team is 16.

470
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:49,125
- Okay, so maybe they're
just not interested, or--
- They're avoiding her.

471
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:52,262
There any cell fragments
in her blood smears?

472
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:57,859
No. Red blood cells were intact.

473
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:06,309
Check 'em again.

474
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:18,612
Blood looks like it's been
put through the blender now.

475
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:21,681
You done yet?
You were right.

476
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:25,320
The rash wasn't a rash.
She's bleeding into her skin.
It's purpura.

477
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:27,728
Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura?

#https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombotisch-thrombozytopenische_Purpura

478
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:30,359
Starts with "T".
You were so close.

479
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:32,335
What could have set it off?

480
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,337
She had no traces of E. coli in her cultures.

481
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,703
She's obviously not menopausal,
so no estrogen.

482
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:39,368
There is one other possible cause.

483
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:43,409
Oh, God.

484
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:53,656
Pregnancy causes...

485
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:55,749
all kinds of chemical
and biological changes...

486
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:57,658
in a woman's body--

487
00:34:57,728 --> 00:35:01,164
or a girl's body,
as the case may be.

488
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:08,934
In extremely rare cases,
everything goes haywire.
It's called T.T.P.

489
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:14,444
Blood starts clotting like crazy
and clogs the vessels
in your brain and kidneys.

490
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:19,950
Red blood cells end up getting shredded
as they squeeze past the clot,

491
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:21,951
like a fat guy in a crowded bar.

492
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:26,422
I'm sure you know what that's like.

493
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:28,686
I mean, you're only 12,
but you're all grown up, right?

494
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:33,025
Travel on your own,
hang out in hotel rooms...

495
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:35,793
getting room service
with your teammates.

496
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:39,598
Maybe someone sneaks in a couple of beers.
You start playing spin the bottle.

497
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:42,730
Next thing you know you're
waking up with nothing on but your socks.

498
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,640
It wasn't like that.
Ofcourse not.

499
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:49,703
- You wanted it.
- Yeah. I did.

500
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,271
He turned out to be a jerk, but--

501
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,545
Actually, under New Jersey law,
the term is felon.

502
00:35:56,954 --> 00:35:59,320
I knew what I was doing.

503
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,491
We're gonna have to do something
called plasmapheresis.

#https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmapherese

504
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:06,121
Cleans the antibodies
from your blood.

505
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:08,825
We're also gonna have
to terminate the pregnancy.

506
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:14,737
You gonna tell my parents?

507
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:19,398
Someone should.
Rock, paper, scissors?

508
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:21,775
They don't need to know.

509
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:24,076
I'll be all right.

510
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:26,173
Ofcourse you will.

511
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:29,515
I mean, if you're old enough
to bleed out of your vagina,

512
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:31,817
then obviously you're mature enough...

513
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:35,620
to handle a simple thing like an abortion
without Mommy and Daddy's help.

514
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:42,622
You gonna tell my parents?

515
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:50,338
Under New Jersey law,
you're the boss.

516
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:02,519
Your daughter has T.T.P.

517
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:04,987
Don't worry. It's curable.
She'll be fine.

518
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:08,787
Well, wait.
I mean, what does T.T.P.
stand for?

519
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:11,895
Some really big words
that you've never heard before...

520
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:13,897
and, when we're done,
will never hear again.

521
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:15,899
Have a nice day.

522
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:20,597
- Well, when can we take her home?
- Uh, in a few days.

523
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:23,868
She needs some minor surgery
to remove the underlying cause...

524
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:27,843
before we can do the...
another really big word.

525
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,380
What's the underlying cause?

526
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:35,910
- She has an abnormal growth
in her abdomen.
- What kind of surgery?

527
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:37,955
It's--
It's very simple.

528
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:40,320
We do it here all the time.

529
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:43,656
- Could you be a little more specific?
- Actually, no.

530
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:47,195
I'm sorry.

531
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:14,991
We're almost done.

532
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:19,963
Hang in there.

533
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,905
You're doing good.

534
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:32,041
Feeling okay?

535
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:34,043
Yeah.
You should be.

536
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:36,909
- Your platelets count's up.
- How's your neck?

#https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombozyt


537
00:38:40,017 --> 00:38:42,815
Looks good.
Anything else we can get you?

538
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:45,378
No, thanks.

539
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:47,822
Okay.

540
00:38:49,293 --> 00:38:52,421
Yeah.

541
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:56,326
Can I see my mom and dad?

542
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:30,264
Plasmapheresis is working.
She's gonna be fine.

543
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:33,269
I know.

544
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:48,518
Hi.
I've got these.

545
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:08,964
I can't even tell you
how much I appreciate...

546
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:11,701
the opportunity to meet with you.

547
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:18,844
- The moment I heard
you had another fellowship opening, I--
- There is no opening.

548
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,984
House.

549
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:24,919
- You have to hire someone.
- I know.

550
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:28,248
Position's been filled.

551
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:34,320
- Why am I interviewing for a position
that's already been filled?
- Exactly.

552
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:40,203
I called to confirm the interview
this morning.

553
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:43,172
You figure if you keep arguing,
I'm gonna cave,

554
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,174
admit it's all a lie and hire you?

555
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:55,414
Do you need your parking validated?

556
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:12,802
I don't wanna interview anyone else.

557
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,804
You're interviewing?

558
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:17,898
I thought you'd just have them
send a head shot
along with their C.V.

559
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:20,910
Ha.

560
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:24,470
That's good,
and why I need you around--

561
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:26,709
to keep me in my place.

562
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:29,446
I can't come back.
I told you that.

563
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,080
- Wasn't listening.
- Right.

564
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:36,390
You want me to listen to you more?
I can do that.

565
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:39,328
Right.

566
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:41,489
I already accepted a position
somewhere else.

567
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:47,068
- With who?
- Yeuell-- at jefferson.

568
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:50,163
- Unaccept it.
- Why?

569
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,771
Because Yeuell is boring.

570
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:58,781
He's pedantic and preachy.

571
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:02,478
Because he's short.

572
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:05,818
Because I want you to come back.

573
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:12,287
Not good enough.

574
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:18,832
Want more money?
A car allowance?

575
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:21,531
Better parking space?

576
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,009
Dinner.

577
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:31,811
And not just a meal
between two colleagues.

578
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:34,180
A date.

579
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:46,254
You'll come back to work...

580
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:48,855
if I go out on a date with you?

581
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:51,333
Yes.

582
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:58,066
Okay.

583
00:42:58,142 --> 00:43:00,076
It's a deal.

584
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:10,510
See you tomorrow morning.

585
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:14,257
Don't be late.

586
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:16,259
I won't.
