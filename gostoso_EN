Wonderful, how life should be, is to lie with your legs up, stay at home alone when parents go on a trip, the first day of vacation, the teacher getting sick on the day of the test, being madly in love, taking off tight shoes, bathing in the sea, traveling with your girlfriend, traveling with your boyfriend, drinking hot chocolate in the winter, eating ice cream in the summer, opening Christmas

listening to music, riding a bike, showering under a waterfall, spending the whole day watching TV, getting a new toy, believing in Santa Claus, not believing in the boogeyman, a beautiful sunny day

Pole, falling in love with the first teacher, playing doctor, kissing the dad, kissing the mom, saying I love you, hearing someone say I love you, giving a scare, not being scared, looking into the eyes, discovering a friend, laughing a lot, chatting about nothing, cleaning the drawers, wearing old, loose clothes, the smell of freshly washed clothes, baby smell, baby skin, opening a present, cheating on a test, receiving flowers, feeling lazy, weekend at the cousins', eating with your hands, lying on a lap, swinging in a hammock, walking barefoot on the grass, laughing for no reason, having good memories, looking at the photo album, collecting things, shopping, spending a lot of money, earning a lot of money, never worrying about money, dancing close, bubble bath, sleeping between mom and dad, being carried to bed, looking at the stars, pillow fight, turning off the alarm and continuing to sleep, being the lead singer of a rock band, being a ballerina on Madonna's tour, eating cornstarch cookies in the car, no homework, no math tests, no physics, no chemistry, no Portuguese, no history, nothing, only nice things, very nice things, extremely nice things, nice like life should be.

Sometimes we get lost in a sea of problems and forget the details as wonderful as those described above, we allow ourselves to be involved in things that, although they are on the way, do not have the importance in our mission. On the corridor of life, there are many doors, and God gives us the free will to choose, sometimes some doors take time to open, mine took almost 9 years, but those 9 years were very important for my life, because at HP I developed my professional side, I know that I am still not completely mature, but this new challenge will complete what I started here.

I know that distance will weaken the bonds, but the memories of intensely lived moments will be my book of the best memories of you.

I thank each one of you from the heart for everything and for all the moments lived, and for what each one of you contributed directly or indirectly to my professional and/or personal life."
